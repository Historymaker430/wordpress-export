              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Matthew 2:3, “When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.”</strong></p>\r\nWhat causes you to get angry? Perhaps there are certain situations or people that seem to cause anger to rise up in you. According to the Scriptures anger alone is not a sin. The Scriptures says, be angry and sin not or in your anger do not sin. One thing that seems to make most people excited however is the birth of a child. When a child is born many come to see the newborn and rejoice with the family to whom the child has been born. However, can you picture any reason why one would become angry because of a newborn? This was the response of King Herod to the news of the birth of Jesus Christ.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nMatthew tells us, “<strong>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, 2 saying, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.”</strong> Why would these Magi which had had traveled from the East, most likely from Persia, first go to King Herod the Roman King to inquire of the newborn Jewish King? Where else would one go to find a King but in a palace? However, God in His Divine Providence moved Christ to safety because God knew of the mutiny that Herod plotted against Jesus. Matthew describes the response of Herod about the news of Jesus’ birth, “<strong>When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him”.</strong> What was it that caused King Herod to become angry and troubled and ALL JERUSALEM WITH HIM?!?! At this time Herod was the King, although he himself was not Jewish he was the King of the Jews as the Jewish people were under Roman authority.\r\n\r\nThe Expositor’s Bible Commentary explains that,<em> “In contrast with the Magi's desire to worship the King of the Jews, Herod is deeply troubled. In this \"all Jerusalem\" joins him, not because most of the people would have been sorry to see Herod replaced or because they were reluctant to see the coming of King Messiah, but because they well knew that any question like the Magi's would result in more cruelty from the ailing Herod, whose paranoia had led him to murder his favorite wife and two sons</em>.” WOW, a King that murdered his own wife and sons, no wonder he had no problem desiring to murder the new born King, the Son of God!. Hatred is murder of the heart according to God as John wrote, “<strong>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.”</strong> Herod did not want to be replaced, and the people did not wish to experience Herod’s killing tirade as he played no favorites when it came to murder. If Christ were to take the throne and be crowned King, what would that mean for Herod? 1. Herod would no longer be King, 2. The Jews would now look to their own King, 3. The authority Herod had over the Jews would now be passed to Jesus 4. Jerusalem would no longer be under the rule of Herod but under the rule of Jesus\r\n\r\nIn the natural I can see why Herod was troubled and angry of this newborn King. This would mean King Herod would be out, and King Jesus would sit on the throne in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nChrist’s desires to have the natural sinful Herod heart off the throne, and for Him to have rule and reign over your life. Do you worship like the Magi or become troubled, angry and rebellious like Herod as Christ assumes Kingship over your life. Perhaps today is a day of humble repentance for you. As you examine your response to King Jesus, is it truly one of worship or is Herod’s heart beating in your life?\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>2Timothy 1:5-6, \"I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well. For this reason I remind you to FAN INTO FLAME the GIFT of GOD, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.\" -</strong>\r\n\r\nI pray that this day my message finds you and that you'll be boldly strengthened by the LORD. That the fear of God (<strong>Proverbs 1:7</strong>) will lead you as the shoes of Christ's gospel confidently tread forward. We should not be ashamed of HIS testimony, but rather we should share in the SUFFERING for the Gospel by the power of God<strong> (2 Timothy 1:8).<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nRecently, I've been encouraged and spiritually sharpened (<strong>Proverbs 27:17</strong>) by the preacher, Keith Daniels. I know many of you, as Godly men and women, have heard of this man of God. I say that 3 word phrase with complete and utter understanding. MAN. OF. GOD. So few people today who take the name PASTOR are truly living as such. Keith Daniels is one of those very few on the narrow road that are PRESSING forward as we all run the race to God. I encourage all of you to hear his sermons, and I guarantee that you'll tremble at the awesome power of God that spews like rushing water from his mouth. He sincerely loves the LORD, and desires nothing BUT to serve Him.\r\n\r\nAmen, thank you LORD. Paul addresses his spiritual son, Timothy, while Paul knows that his time on earth is at its end, and his first step into eternity with the LORD awaits past the prison cell that he presently found himself in. Notice how Paul lets Timothy understand that he is only telling him this spiritual secret because of his sincere faith. The faith that his grandmother, his mother, and now Timothy had. That is the ONLY reason why Paul continues. I wonder, where is your faith? WHERE IS YOUR FAITH? \"<strong>Without faith it is IMPOSSIBLE to please God\" (Hebrews 11:6)</strong>. If you know about Jesus and the work of the Cross, but have not the faith to live the life He's called you to-WHERE is your faith?! When you're at work, and the Holy Spirit tugs at your heart to speak the LIFE of the Gospel into the dead and lost souls at the office, are you responding? Or is your faith not up to par? In <strong>Ezekiel 16:1-6</strong>, did the LORD leave Israel wallowing in its own blood, completely defenseless to its enemy's? Why then should we walk by souls wallowing in their SIN while CHRIST bore the sin that WE were wallowing in on the CROSS!?\r\n\r\n\"FAN INTO FLAME THE GIFT!\" The gift. What gift? Some say the Holy Spirit while others say Timothy had a special calling as a pastor, teacher or evangelist. But I challenge you to think that shouldn't we as vessels of the Gospel and of the Holy Spirit Himself be called to all three? FAN into FLAME men and women of God!. In today's society it is so easy to slip into the lie of comfort. As Christians we are not called to comfort. We have comfort to know that our souls are saved, but we live in agony for the souls of the lost! Go forth now, as ministers and disciples of the LORD Jesus Christ today, and continue on your walk. I pray you've been encouraged, and I pray that we take seriously the things of God. From the smallest to the biggest. Take seriously the things of God. May God equip you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBrother Christopher.\r\n\r\nChristopher J. Keck\r\n\r\n<em>\r\n\"Jesus answered him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God'\". - John 3:3</em>"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Genesis 32:26, \"And He said, \"Let Me go, for the day breaks. \" But he said, \"I will not let you go unless You bless me!\"</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>We serve a God of too much</strong>, God of abundance, God of no limitations. If I look at the story of Jacob and Esau, Jacob deceived his brother and took away his birthright. He then deceived his father to take away his brother's intended blessing. He also deceived his father in-law and made the best for himself, the only one he could not deceive was God. For what he desired, he had to come clean. Who does not want blessings?<!--more--> people bring their children to church to be dedicated and blessed, who does not want a blessed marriage, blessed home, blessed children to mention a few? Who can say that they have enough blessings to want more? Jacob had been blessed with one beautiful wife and one fruitful wife, he had children, possessions, servants, maid servants. He was blessed as you can see but God brought him to a place where he would desire more blessings but not in terms of material blessings.<strong> Genesis 32:24, \"The Jacob was left alone; and a Man wrestled with him until the breaking day\".</strong> Alone in His presence, where the former life did not dictate what God would do in his life. Despite the fact that you have things to make you comfortable, there is more to desire. I don't know why he wrestled with the Man (God), maybe he wanted to manipulate his way like he always did only to fail.<strong> This is a blessing not worth fighting (he was not worthy to fight for it in the first place), it was a blessing worth asking for</strong>. Why fight to be blessed when all you can do is ask?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Genesis 32:26, \"And He said, \"Let Me go, for the day breaks. \" But he said, \"I will not let you go unless You bless me!\"</strong> I have been blessed over and over again yet I still need more blessings. The fact He has continued to bless me is an indication I will blessed till my time on this earth expires. I will not let Him go unless He blesses me, when He does, I will not let Him go unless He has blessed me some more. Jacob had been called names, he had a history, but this time He desired a true blessing from above. Yes God might have blessed him through other people even in his failures but this time He wanted the best from above.<strong> vs. 29, \"...And He blessed Him</strong>\". All we need is ask for a blessing and all He desires is to give it to us. Are you afraid of asking for a blessing because you failed yesterday, last week or long time ago? Jacob had his past failures but that did not stop him from asking for a blessing. To show that he really needed the blessing, he held on to God till He blessed him. On that day, Jacob's name, the deceiver, the conman was blessed with a name change from Jacob to Israel. The name change shows a nation of Israel, blessed beyond what he could have imagined or thought. He did not specify the kind of blessings he desired, he let God bless Him with what God had reserved for him. I have blessings put on layaway, has my name on it, no one can take it for Jesus paid it all. I will not leave the counter until that which the Lord had put on layaway has been released to me. Of all the blessings through gifts that we receive from people, there is no greater blessing than the one from the Father. His blessings are not disappointing because He knows what I need.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What are the blessings you desire? I’m going to go with Paul on this one, I desire more spiritual blessing than anything else. Paul says in<strong> Ephesian 1:3-14, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, 4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love, 5 having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved. 7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace 8 which He made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 9 having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself, 10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth—in Him. 11 In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will, 12 that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory. 13 In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory”</strong>. BLESS ME LORD.

              "<strong>Hebrews 12:1&amp;2, \"1...and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, 2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; ...\" (KJV)</strong>\r\n\r\nI recently shared on the subject of “patience”, it is vital for me to share more as there are some folks battling. Our patience is tested while on traffic; check out lines at the stores, at an entrance gate to a game etc. We struggle with patience because we would rather be the ones in front of everyone else, which makes us selfish if you think about it. In as much as you would like to be the one the front, the person on the front also deserves a chance. Is it about me? (just an input but not the direction for the message today).\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe word \"patience\" appears 33 times in NT. God is referred in <strong>Romans 15:5</strong> as the God of patience. Would we say that the generation after the OT struggled with patience? To some extent yes. In OT, Moses, David, Abraham, Jacob, Isaac, Esther, Jeremiah, David, Naomi and others endured with patience to see God’s promises fulfilled. Some did not see those promises come to pass in their lifetime yet at a distance, they embraced them.\r\n\r\nThe writer of Hebrews (not known) reminded believers including himself to run with patience the race set before them (us). Sometime back while watching the Olympics marathon, it was a 26-mile participated by many. If you know marathon, it is the kind of race that requires proper practice/preparation, patience and endurance. It took the winner 2hrs 05 Mins to complete the race. As I was watching it, there were times the runners were running on plain ground, at times up a hill. The hot sun made them slow down at times. The person who was at one point leading was pushed off his truck by one of the spectators. It did affect his speed and left him shaken but he would not quit the race. They were all running with patience, grabbing water to quench their thirst. They were looking forward to the finish line. To some it did not matter if they were not first on the finish line, all that mattered was that they finished the race.\r\n\r\nOur race with and in Christ is no different, it requires patience and endurance. It is a long journey but we are getting closer and closer to the finish line, <strong>Romans 13:11, \"...for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed\".</strong> Our finish line is Jesus, we look to Him. You know of those who you started the race with in Christ, some quit running and some reduced their speed tremendously but you have continued to run the race with your eyes fixed on Jesus. You and I are like the marathon runners running a race with endurance. Jesus ran His race here on earth with patience and a beautiful example is the process of His crucifixion. He could have just had someone spear Him to death and still He would have died for mankind but the bible says, \"<strong>Christ must suffer\"</strong>, that involves patience and endurance. Paul went through patience and endurance facing difficult times yet he would not quit why? because His eyes were fixed on Jesus the author and the finisher of his faith. Did he finish his marathon race even after all the hardships? Yes, he did <strong>2Timothy 4:7, \"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</strong>” <b>Despite the battles, he fought a good fight; despite the obstacles, he finished the race; despite the trials, he kept the faith</b> and that is what I am looking forward to. It's about being faithful till the end. I know of those times when this race gets so hard, so tiring, obstacles, barriers, trials. Like the rest, the feeling of quitting presents itself, the enemy keeps reminding you to quit. Didn't he whisper the same to Jesus? All I know is that I am getting closer and closer as I run the race with patience. <strong>I am far from where I started and I am closer to where I am going.</strong><strong> If I can just hang on a little while and keep looking to the One who can give me strength to finish the race, I will join Paul and many saints who finished the race with joy. We ought to be persevering saints, let us keep running</strong>.

              "<strong>1Timothy 4:8, \"For bodily exercise profits a little, ...\"</strong>\n\nWhen you work so hard in the day, you feel tired and worn out. Any activity you add to it is expected to make you even more tired. The body which is suppose to be the temple of God ought to be looked after. This goes with what you do with it and what you put in it. We ought to do everything to maintain it, not only will we be doing what is right before God, it will also be to our benefit. How often do you see people abuse their bodies? They drink their heads off, inject drugs into their body system and not care for their body at all. How many know smoking is bad for their health but still do it? There are Christians who can't quit smoking, some struggle and some don’t want to. If you thought that God only cares about your spiritual being, think again. God cares about our spirit, soul and body, emphasis in that order. Though the body is not the number one, He formed it and gave everything needed to care for it. They say cleanliness (healthy) is next to Godliness.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nPaul writes to Timothy by saying bodily exercise profits a little. So we can say that bodily exercise does profit. Sometimes back I started to exercise and found that it had such great benefit and impact to my body. I thought leaving work tired and going to the gym to work out was going to make me more tired only to realize that it increased my mental alertness, left me refreshed, created good eating habit and made me stronger. It's been profiting, it's causing my body to relax and be in good health. Not only that, it has created a balance, spiritual and physical. When your body is weak and tired, it becomes hard to work your spiritual life. Remember when the bible says, <strong>the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak</strong>, tired, worn out? If you can get the body strong, the spirit will not work overtime to get the body in tune with it. I have found that my prayer life has increased as the common feeling of always being tired has reduced. I now have the strength to wake up early and pray. This has revived my spiritual life even more.<strong> I believe that how you treat your body has away of impacting your spiritual life</strong>. It may just be a little thing, but it's significant. God's children ought to be in good health resulting from exercise and proper nutrition and not being careless, overweight and sloppy. All this calls for discipline as you set yourself to do things you would not normally do, but because you care about your physical health, you will do it anyway. No one wants to have conditions of heart problems, high blood pressures etc this is why physical exercise reduces the intensity of many illnesses or the risk of developing them. But how, you can start by doing some walking, running, press ups, in other words, exercise.\n\nDid you ever think that bodily exercise does profit? The bible says yes, <strong>the willing spirit needs a disciplined body </strong> <strong>for health, strength and endurance to make it</strong>. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>1Timothy 6:12, \"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses\"</strong>.\r\n\r\nChristians fight battles every day. If you are not fighting battles, you may need to examine yourself and see if you are in the faith. I'm yet to meet someone who has no battles to fight. Every one will tell us of some types battle they are engaged in. People don’t engage themselves in battles to be losers, they battle because they want to win. The devil hopes you will throw down your weapons and surrender. Who in their right mind would do that?\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong> I have come to realize that our winning strategy in a battle is not necessarily based on how strong we are but how willing we are to fight our way through.</strong> In a boxing match, the boxers are tough, trained to fight to win and so is in wrestling. For us believers, we are reminded that <strong>the battle is not for the strong neither is the race for the swift but for those who endure.</strong>\r\n\r\nFight is to strive vigorously and resolutely or to contend with a struggle against or a confrontation between opposing groups in which they attempt to harm or gain power over. Fight involves force, tactics and skills to over overcome. To continue to live for Christ requires fights everyday and that means fighting temptations, fears, depression etc. In <strong>2Timothy 2:3, says, \"You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ\".</strong> This reminds us that for us to maintain the free gift of eternal life, we must by all means fight to endure all things that try to take it off our hands. As soldiers we go to the battle field to fight and not just fight but fight to win. Fighting to win will require endurance as we push our enemy back. It's our responsibility to fight for the truth.\r\n\r\n<strong>1Timothy 6:12, \"Fight the good fight of faith...\"</strong>. We can fight but the question is, are we fighting the good fight? the good fight is fighting that which we know is right in the sight of the Lord. While writing to Timothy, Paul tells him to fight the good fight of faith meaning fight for your salvation, defend it, nurture it because there will be things that will come around to terminate it. Then he tells him, \".<b>..l</b><strong>ay hold on eternal life\"</strong>, to remind him to cling on to the gift of eternal life he had received to which he made the declaration in the presence of many witnesses. Paul is advising Timothy all these that in the long run, he may look back at the many battles he endured and rejoice over them. Many terminate their salvation because the fight is fierce but who said it will be an easy journey? Salvation is free, maintaining it requires a fight.\r\n\r\n<strong>2Timothy 4:7, \"I have fought a good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith</strong>\". Think about Paul speaking these things and look at the battles in his life. They took away his freedom, they stoned and left him for dead, they took away his possessions, his future, churches he ministered in, his life. <b>One</b><strong> thing they could not take away from him was his faith</strong>. He fought a good fight by enduring life obstacles, he finished his race without giving up or fainting on the way. I can't tell what speed he was doing but the speed did not matter, the fact that he finished the race shows how faithful he was. And most definitely, he kept the faith (salvation).\r\n\r\nIt's worth fighting the good fight of faith even when everything around you is falling apart. Everything can be taken away but your faith unless you give it away in other words let go. It's not how you start that matters, it's how you fight, endure and finish. Any one can start a marathon but who will endure to the finish line? Can you say in the long run, \"<strong>I fought a good fight, I finished the race, I kept the faith?\". </strong>Fight the good fight till the end. Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>Isaiah 60:1, \"Arise, shine; For your light has come! and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you\"</strong>\n\nThree key things to share with us are on the scripture introduced above. When we get saved, it is like a new born baby. The birth of he baby is not the end but the beginning. Often times those some who have been in Christ for a while tend to lose the fire and become regular people meaning everything else is normal. No zeal to grow, no zeal to witness, no zeal to pray effectively, or zeal to even read the word with passion. It's very easy to lose fruits without knowing, we need to therefore constantly do spiritual evaluation to see where we are. I know of people who used to talk about the Lord strongly, they had such a joy and enthusiasm but something somewhere happened and the zeal began to fade away only to be left with a form of godliness and deny the power.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n“<strong>Arise, shine”</strong> are the first two keys to bring to our attention. Let's define the word ARISE, this is a simple word to mean get up or rise up. Anyone who is getting ready for a greater move has to be in a position ready to get up and will do whatever it takes to get up. You cannot move from point A to point B unless there is something that causes you to desire to relocate. “Shine” is to glow, excel, sparkle, glitter. Interestingly, shinning requires some effort. Normally when polishing my shoes, once I apply the shoe polish, it does not make it shine when application is done until I begin to work on it by shining it with the brush and dry cloth. It takes time to shine as desire, determination and patience are put into practice. Paul advising Timothy on how to arise and shine, shared with him in <strong>1Timothy 4:12, \"Let no man despise your youth (point of rising by not allowing anyone to despise his youth), but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity (all these were to be his way of shinning)\".</strong> If he worked on all these, he was definitely going to shine and not for himself but for the Lord for the bible says that <strong>whatsoever you do, do it unto the Lord</strong>. Yes the light had already come, but he needed work on it and put it somewhere where all could see, <strong>Matthew 5:14-15, \"You are the light of the world. A city set on the hill cannot be hidden nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lamp stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house\".</strong> <strong>We are called to rise up and shine for we are the candles God will use to light other people who either their candles were blown off by the winds of the world or the ones who have never had their candles lit up.</strong>\n\nThe number three key is <strong>\"...and the glory of the Lord is risen upon you</strong>\", this is the gas that keeps the light shinning for when we begin to talk about the glory of the Lord, we are talking about a divine light, it's the light that shines in the middle of the darkness, it's the light that nothing can dim and what a blessing to be connected to that source of power and when I feel like my light is gonna go off, the gas of the glory boosts my lamp that I may keep burning, shinning, glowing. Someone said that the smallest light can be seen in the middle of darkness therefore we are not intimidated to think our light is small, it can be seen in the middle of darkness. Be encouraged the way Paul encouraged Timothy and know that He has called you to rise, shine for His glory fuels your existence. He who called you to rise and shine, knew you could do it as long as His glory is present. Blessings Ev"

              "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jeremiah 33:3, “Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know”</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not too long ago I was watching a DVD entitled “extreme engineering”. It was a DVD about how some mega structures have been built. One mega structure that caught my attention was one about building a railroad. They surveyed the area by which the rail would pass. There were different obstacles, a major one being a mountain in front of them. Instead of going around it which was impossible, they only had one choice, to make a way through the mountain however hard it was going to be, attempting the impossible with what they had. With the mountain before them, they had to bring in the right equipment to break through to the other side. They used explosives to create a path.<!--more--></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We too are building roads to our futures and there are obstacles everyday small and big. We have mountains standing in the way, the question is, what do we do about them?<strong> Without prayers as your explosive device, there is no way you will breakthrough</strong>. There is something about prayers that should not be taken lightly.<strong> Prayers pave a way for God to move</strong>.<strong> Prayer works because God works through prayers</strong>. There are things God wills and then waits for His children to call on Him. It shows we trust Him with what we are facing; it’s bringing the right tools (Person) into your situation. When we pray, we are bringing God into our situations for we know we can do nothing without Him. He is like the explosive that breaks through obstacles and making way for us<strong>. Psalm 18:32, “It is God who arms me with strength, And makes my way perfect”, 2Samuel 22:33, “God is my strength and power, And He makes my way perfect”</strong>.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prayer affects three different Spheres of existence as E.M. Bounds puts it, “<strong>The Divine, the angelic and the human. It puts God to work, it puts the angels to work and it puts people to work.”</strong> Prayer puts everyone to work.<strong> \"Prayer is simply faith resting in, acting with, leaning on and obeying God.”</strong> Those who know their God will value prayers, their lives fully depend on it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In our tough economic times and other things happening, who would you rather put your trust in, in God or the government, stocks and bond or faith in God? The bible says<strong>, Psalm 20:7, “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But we will remember the name of the LORD our God.” Psalm 118:8, “It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.” </strong>How will you and I show the Lord we trust Him if we don’t call upon Him in our prayers to answer us?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This quote continues to bless my heart because it’s the heart of prayers by great missionary<strong> Hudson Taylor,</strong> who said<strong>,</strong> \"<strong>The prayer power has never been tried to its full capacity. If we want to see Divine power wrought in the place of weakness, failure, and disappointment, let us answer God's standing challenge</strong>,<strong> Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.”</strong> We bring Him into the picture by praying and He will do great and mighty things we cannot do. Arise O God, demonstrate your power.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With what is happening, we need God now more than ever; we need to pray like we’ve never done before. The more we pray, the more we show God we are not depending on ourselves, we are depending on Him. He is our explosive through the obstacles of life. He is the way maker.

              "<strong>Romans 8:29-30, “29For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son, … 30And those he predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified” (NIV)</strong>\r\n\r\nEver sat down to wonder why The Almighty God who has better things to do has something to do with your life? That He is concerned with your daily affairs. That He takes keen interest of your day-to-day walk, that He loves you in spite of your flaws. That He forgives you when you find it hard to forgive yourself. That He has a plan for your life when all you can see is a future clouded with failures. David says, “<strong>LORD, what is man, that You take knowledge of him? Or the son of man, that You are mindful of him?,\" Psalm 144:3</strong>. I wish you would grasp and embrace this thought that the Lord knows your beginning, your middle, and your end, and nothing that happens in your life and mine has any threat to what He wants to do. You can beat yourself up daily because of what you face and struggle with, or like Paul, you can encourage yourself with these words, <strong>2Timothy 1:12, …, FOR I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED and am PERSUADED that HE IS ABLE to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day”.<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nHow often do we feel God has forsaken us or does not know us? His word to us this day is that He FOREKNEW us even before we knew ourselves, He tells Jeremiah, “<strong>Before I formed thee, I KNEW thee</strong>”, in other words, \"I created you for a purpose\". God did not create you then found something for you to do, He created you for a purpose He had in mind FOR YOU for His own glory. For this reason He predestined us to be conformed to the likeness of His Son. We were created with a destiny, Jesus being the picture of what we would be. <strong>John 1:12,</strong> tells us “<strong>But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right (power) to BECOME children of God…”</strong> The end result, the final product, is to be like Jesus, and the process, we are BECOMING (getting there), the fuel to become is the power through receiving Him. Even though we are still “becoming”, we are glad to know what we will be like (our end result).\r\n\r\nWhen God predestined you, the calling was part of it. Either you have received it or you are yet to receive it. To some it has been revealed what God requires of them, to some, God is about to. <strong>Ephesians 1:17-19, “17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; THAT YOU MAY KNOW WHAT IS THE HOPE OF HIS CALLING, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power</strong>”. We can be revived today knowing that God is not done with us regardless of how cold, rigid, rugged, dormant we are. God has taken knowledge of us and He is mindful of our beginning, middle and our end. Our future may be clouded but we know that God is the Pilot who will help us land safely. Thank God that even though we are not there yet, we are becoming, “…<strong>for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed” Romans</strong> <strong>13:11.</strong>. <strong>We are saved, we are being saved and we shall be saved</strong>. <strong>1John 3:2, “Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.”</strong> blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 8:29-30, “For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son, … 30And those he predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified” (NIV).</strong>\n \nOur journey in and with Christ is one day at a time, this ought to be our prayer every day. God does not get us to our destiny fast because He is in the business of forming and filling. We realize that forming takes time compared to filling. If we can withstand the forming, filling will be no problem. How can we expect to be filled without being formed? In our text, we can see a continuous forming as we become. Look at the potter with the clay in His hand, even though the clay does not look like what He has in mind, in the mind of the potter, it’s a done deal. He only needs to form it into what he wants to form into. Someone wrote a book entitled, “God is not in a hurry,” I agree.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe bible says, “<strong>..those he called, He also JUSTIFIED“</strong>, how hard to feel justified when sometimes we don’t even understand what justification is all about. According to the dictionary, one of the definitions of “justify” is to “DECLARE FREE OF BLAME”. Can we say we are free of blame? what have we done to be justified anyway? how hard have we tried in our own efforts to do things that will make us justified? <strong>Romans 3:23,says “for ALL have sinned and FALL SHORT of the glory of God“</strong>. We’ve quoted this scripture many times but the question to ask, how short have we fallen? maybe we have fallen short enough to make if for the shortage to be justified. There is nothing in our own strength that can make us justified. Some religion teach that we have to make our way to God. The bible teaches that God has made a way for us to Himself. This is where <strong>Romans 5:1</strong> comes in , “<strong>Therefore, having been JUSTIFIED by FAITH, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ“.</strong> How I praise God that we are not justified by works otherwise we would all be in trouble for we have fallen SHORT, very short of His glory. He has taken all the blame, guilt and shame away because of our faith in Christ. <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9, “8For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast</strong>.” Our spirit is made new, not our body. Now the body is being formed that it might become; being transformed.\n \nWhat blows my mind is that God did not leave us at justification to which I am ok with, He has gone a step further to glorify them that He justified. How can we grasp this? we cease from being just children of God to sons and daughters. Listen to how God glorified Job, <strong>Job 1:8, “Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?”</strong> Are you glad that the Father brags about you to the enemy? yes, you may be weak, failed, and miserable yet He turns and calls those things, which are not as though they were simply because He has clothed each of us with garments of righteousness, and instead of the enemy seeing us, he sees God’s justification in our lives. In addition, God says, “He is my son or she is my daughter, have you considered them?”.\n \nMay our minds be renewed (transformed) to see ourselves the way the Father sees us and become what the Father wants us to become. If you are not saved yet, you have no covering and should do something about it. Do you see yourself becoming more and more like Jesus? I do. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Luke 15:11-31, \"12 And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.’ So he divided to them his livelihood… 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, 19 and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”’</strong>\n\nThe parable of the prodigal son is the most familiar of all Christ's parables. It has more than one lesson if you study it carefully. The prodigal son is an example of sound repentance having lived a life of self.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nTo glean some truth from this passage, let us look at how his story begins. <strong>Vs. 12” And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me”.</strong> I find this request to be very strange and here is why, no one would ask for inheritance when the father was still alive. It is like asking for the will to be executed when the person who wrote the will is still alive. Is not this request by this young man suggests he wished his father was dead so as to gain his inheritance? It was like the father was taking too long to die and since he could not wait to get his hands on the inheritance (on the blessing), he chose to act now. The tragedy of today is that most want blessings now but do not want God of the blessings. This is the same picture of those who want to go to heaven not so that they can be with God and worship Him for eternity but that they would escape the nasty place called hell and not suffer there for eternity. This act also pictures all sinners (related to God the Father by creation), who waste their potentials, privileges and refuse any relationship with God, choosing instead a life of sinful self-indulgence suppressing truth in unrighteousness so as to get rid of the thought of God in their minds. If they have a god, it’s god in their making to suit themselves. Paul says in <strong>Romans 1:21-23, “21 because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man—and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things”</strong>\n\nThe root of all sin as well stated by John Wesley, is “<em>… A desire of disposing of ourselves of independency on God”</em>. The sin nature is to take off God’s hand of covering in our lives, our family, our nation only to leave us vulnerable to all attacks. The prodigal son went far away, eliminating that connection with his father that would allow protection, guidance, continued provision and most important, relationship. On 09/11/2001 that fateful day when two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in NYC claiming lives, the following few weeks many people returned to church and some even for the first time. Over 10 years later, many many people have forgotten God, stopped going to church, stopped seeking God’s blessings, guidance, wisdom, protection, and like the prodigal son gone far away from Him. In 2011, the mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg banned clergy and prayer at tenth anniversary commemoration ceremony of 9/11. This is a clear indication of not wanting God’s hands in the lives of people, government, nation etc,\n\nHow can we stand without the hand of God? And more so, do we want God more than we want His blessings? The question we each should wrestle with,<strong> “Is God an end or is He a means”?</strong> Do we love our freedom that we would choose to distance ourselves from Him even wishing He was dead whether we say it or not, or wished He did not exist to therefore live the way you want to? Now we may think this is applicable only to those who have not been saved, but come to think of it, we could have an idol in our own lives. What is an idol? <strong>Anything that takes precedence over your life in the place of God</strong>. Is your marriage, children, job, business your idol or is God supreme and sovereign over all? The prodigal son had a lifestyle he wanted to live and take precedence over his life, he therefore chose to go to his father and say “GIVE ME…”. I will share on his return to the father. May the Lord help us. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Luke 15:11-31, \"21 And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.’ So he divided to them his livelihood… 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, 19 and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”’\r\n</strong>\r\nWhile we know the story of the prodigal son having taken his inheritance and gone to a far country and wasted it all, I would like to dwell on his coming back home because it’s a powerful message most churches have forgotten. <strong>Repentance is the forgotten doctrine in most churches, foreign to many coming to God</strong>, no wonder General William Booth the founder of Salvation Army said, “<em>The Chief danger of Christianity in 20th century will be…Religion without the Holy Ghost; Christianity without Christ; Forgiveness without repentance; Salvation without regeneration; Politics without God; And heaven without hell”.</em>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOne prominent preacher (I use that title loosely in talking about him) said in an interview not too long ago that “<em>People come alive when they realize ‘God is for ME. He’s got a plan for MY life, and I can do something GREAT. I can be who He wants ME to be… We should be happy every day</em>”. The late Keith Green in response to such a gospel said, “ <em>It’s Me-Centered Instead of Christ-Centered. First and foremost, it is the gospel that appeals to the selfish. Instead of honoring God, it places the sinner at the center of God’s love and plan. But the Bible places Jesus at the center of God’s plan, not the sinner”.</em>\r\n\r\nWhat picture do we see with the prodigal son? when he came to his senses he said <strong>vs. 18 “I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you”</strong>. In the state of being broken and crushed, and hungry, and open, and yielded, and abandoned, he arose, and came to his father to repent towards God and to his earthly father. In preaching about repentance, Paris Reidhead said, “<em>Repentance is not just “being sorry” – that is only conviction. Repentance is not merely a change of heart and a change of mind; it is a change of action, change of direction.”</em> Repentance is here pictured as a journey.<strong> It is more than a mere emotion or impulse</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> Vs. \"19 and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants” </strong><em>\"The church used to confess its sins, now it confesses its rights\", David Wilkerson</em> We live as though God owes us and we continue to hear it promised to us in one way or another from some pulpits. This young man was not coming back to claim any inheritance, no, he had nothing. The one he was going back to is the same one he wished was dead. Oh how we would see how wretched and miserable we are in need of God, not because we are worthy but because He is. A stanza on this hymn Rock of Ages is what I see in this young man’s attitude and ours ought to be, “<em><strong>Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to the cross I cling</strong>; Naked, come to Thee for dress; Helpless look to Thee for grace; Foul, I to the fountain fly; Wash me, Savior, or I die”</em>. <strong>He came seeking to be made what his flesh hated in the beginning\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThose who are coming are those who are done with self, done with living the way they want to, done with rejecting the Savior who loves them and are coming not to claim any rights but simply to cling. These are the people who have been called by Him, called to Him, called from the world. They been broken in His presence, and now the only desire is to be made servants living only to the glory, and the honor, and the praise of His name, such God will not deny. <strong>James 4:6, “God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble”</strong>, to finish.

              "<strong>Luke 15:20-22, “20 And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 21 And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ 22 “But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is the magnificent attribute of God that sets Him apart from all the false gods invented by men. He is not indifferent or hostile, but a Savior by nature, longing to see sinners repent and rejoicing when they do. We see this kind of love demonstrated by the father of the prodigal son, who when he saw his son coming he had compassion on him, ran, fell on his neck, kissed him. The son did not even finish his rehearsed words of repentance before the father intercepted to grant forgiveness. <strong>This is a picture of God’s eagerness to forgive.<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nThen here comes three things he instructs his servants to do for this son, Clothe him in ROBE which is reserved for guest of honor and also to cover his nakedness. He is also given a RING, a symbol of authority, and SANDALS, slaves did not wear sandals. In other words, his father MADE HIM a son again; full restoration to sonship.\r\n\r\nLet me side track here and talk about the believers, unlike the prodigal son who had a biological father which gave him some rights, we are not sons and daughters of God by RIGHT but by ADOPTION. According to the Bible dictionary, “<em>Adoption is the giving to any one the name and place and privileges of a son who is not a son by birth”</em>. Those who are adopted now belong and are called blessed. In <strong>Ephesians 1:3,5,6</strong>, Paul writes “<strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ… 5 having predestined us to adoption as sons by Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, 6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved”</strong>. Blessed God has blessed us with spiritual blessings because He has adopted us through Jesus Christ to Himself. “<em>Human parents can bestow their love, resources, and inheritance on adopted child, but not their own distinct characteristics. But God miraculously gives His own nature to those whom He has elected and who have trusted Christ. He makes them His children in the image of His divine Son, giving them not just Christ’s riches and blessings but also His very nature</em>”, John MacArthur, amen\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 8:14-16, “14For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. 15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” 16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God</strong>. To quote Barton W. Johnson, “<em>Paul was writing to the Romans, among whom the adoption of children, not their own by nature, was common. They would understand this to mean that those converted, or born again, are adopted as children of God; upon those thus adopted he bestows his Spirit; this Spirit in their hearts produces a loving trust that enables them to address God as Father.”\r\n</em>\r\nAdoption is a parent choosing the baby to adopt, not the other way round. When the adoption takes place, the nature of the relationship changes. For this reason, God has made us to be partakers of the divine nature. God had one only-begotten Son, and He was pleased for His own glory, to choose out of a lost world many to become His adopted sons. He also made us heirs, <strong>Romans 8:17,”… and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified togethe</strong>r\r\n\r\nOne who comes with the heart of a servant is made a son yet with a servant’s heart. He knows he does not deserve it, he knows he is been adopted. He did not work hard to earn this position, he was only made. The prodigal son’s father showed him grace and mercy out of the love he had for his son. The same God does for us who come to Him. He gives us what He has set aside for His Son for us whom He has adopted. This is love, perfecting love. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 8:28, \"And we know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose”, NJKV</strong>\r\n\r\nMany times when “bad” things happen to “good” people, the first thing that is said about the situation is “That’s just not fair!” or “Such and Such was a good person.” But you know what? We won’t get it. It’s not our place to try and figure out God’s reasoning behind letting something “bad” happen to a “good” person. “<strong>For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways”, says the Lord. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts”, Isaiah 55:8-9 NJKV</strong> I don’t know about you but the last time I checked the earth was pretty far from heaven. Since this is the case, we cannot possibly completely understand God’s thoughts. And you’ll just get a headache trying to force the issue.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nDid you know that the word ‘<strong>Fair</strong>’ is never used in the Bible to describe God’s character? ‘Fair” appears only as a description for beauty. Now \"<strong>Just</strong>” on the other hand is used over 50 times to describe God. When something is fair, it is limited by our own experiences thereby justifying the event/action. When something is just, it is justified by God’s understanding.\r\n\r\nGod’s justice may not make a lot of sense to us, but know that He makes it all work out in the end, because He has seen it all from beginning to end. “<strong>And we know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose”, Romans 8:28 NJKV</strong>\r\n\r\nTo close I would like to share a thought in light of Lisette’s wonderful message. There is no place more clear to deal with the issue of justice and fairness than looking to the cross of Calvary. If God were merely fair, was it fair to allow His sinless Son to die for sinful, undeserving people? If ever a man could say, “it’s not fair,” it would have been Jesus Christ. It wasn’t fair for Him to go to the cross for you, or for me. Yet, “<strong>While we were yet sinners Christ died for us.</strong>” It is to our benefit that He is not fair, because we would all end up in Hell, because there is no one good, no not even one, Jesus said as He spoke to the rich young ruler. “<strong>Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone, (Mark 10:18).</strong>” This man called Jesus good, apart from calling Him God, and only God is good. In civil law, a good judge must punish crime. If he turns a blind eye to injustice, then he is corrupt and he himself should be punished. “<strong>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; mercy and truth go before your face” (Psalm 89:14)</strong>. God is rich in mercy to all that call upon him <strong>“But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us…” (Ephesians 2:4)</strong>. Eternal life is in Jesus Christ, that is why Jesus said, ”<strong>He who hears My word and believes on Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life”, (John 5:24)</strong>. “<strong>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness, (1 John 1:9).” “We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands, (1 John 2:3).</strong>”Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Lisette Rivera &amp; Pastor Phil &lt;"

              "<strong>1Samuel 1:19-28, “21 Now the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow. 22 But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will take him, that he may appear before the Lord and remain there forever.”</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe by far that to be a mother is one of the most special callings with greater rewards in heaven than that of an evangelist or pastor who may have reached hundreds or even thousands. A mother may take care of one, two, five or even ten children and gain such great rewards because God has a special place in His heart for mothers.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhile this is true, many mothers do not consider this to be one of the greatest ministries. I can understand why when we address it in the light of the time we are living in where success by far is measured in numbers. In God’s economy, success is measured in faithfulness and obedience. We all start the race, it’s not who finishes the race first that receives a crown, it’s all who finish the race regardless of the time.\r\n\r\nLooking at motherhood as a very special calling, I draw our attention to Hannah, Samuel’s mother. Her story is simple, she received a promise of birth having prayed for a son. Elkanah her husband and his household <strong>vs. 3, “…went up from his city yearly to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Shiloh” </strong>As the priest of his own home, he set the spiritual temperature to foster his family in the things of God. <strong>vs. 7 …So it was, year by year, when she (Hannah) went up to the house of the Lord”. </strong>Though it was not required for the women as a command to go and worship in the city, she accompanied her husband and used that opportunity to seek God for a miracle.\r\n\r\nAfter Samuel is born, the next time comes and Elkanah as always gathers his family to lead them to worship and sacrifice, Hannah requests leave not to accompany him<strong>, vs. 21. … for she said to her husband, “Not until the child is weaned; then I will take him, that he may appear before the Lord and remain there forever” </strong>You might say, going to the temple to worship and sacrifice was more important than her being at home with the child or you might even question her priorities. The response from her husband shows he was in favor of her request because it was godly. All she ever desired was to please her Lord by caring for what God gave her, and when the right time comes, she would present him to the Lord for His service. She knew it was an important ministry to wean which means to accustom a child to food other than its mother's milk. I believe it was more than natural food but also spiritual in readiness for his service in the temple. Samuel’s first base to learn faith was at home. The same can be seen with Moses’ parents, <strong>Hebrews 11:23, “By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s command.</strong>” The faith of Moses began with his parents, the faith of Samuel would be the same. Both were preparing them for God’s call, what a ministry.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 23,” So Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him. Only let the Lord establish His word.” Then the woman stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.”</strong> “<em>Hannah, though she felt a warm regard for the courts of God's house, begged to stay at home. God will have mercy, and not sacrifice. Those who are detained from public ordinances, by the nursing and tending of little children, may take comfort from this instance, and believe, that if they do that duty in a right spirit, God will graciously accept them therein.”,</em> Matthew Henry.\r\n\r\nWe ought to take care of our children, not only with an eye to the law of nature as they are ours, but with an eye to the covenant of grace as they are given up to God. This sanctifies the nursing of them, when it is done as unto the Lord. The nurturing, the prayers, the teachings of the mother is preparing the child (children) for greater task in life. And while a mother may think she is only ministering to one child or a handful, she needs to be encouraged that she is ministering to many many more by preparation of their children. In that when the time comes for God to use them like He did with Samuel,<strong> it was Hannah indirectly impacting the world through a son she prepared and offered to the Lord</strong>. Those that have in sincerity devoted their children to God may with comfort pray for them, that God will establish the word sealed to them at the same time that they were sealed for him.\r\n\r\nSo mothers, your children are one of the greatest blessings from the Lord in need of your ministry, <strong>find fulfillment in serving them because you are doing it for the Lord. Their faith begins with you (nurturing, praying, teaching), you will reach more people through how you raise your children. </strong>There is greater reward in this service than the ministry you may be eyeing right now .

              "<strong>1Samuel 9:1-20, \"3 Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to his son Saul, “Please take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the donkeys. 4 So he passed through the mountains of Ephraim and through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. Then he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they did not find them.”</strong>\r\n\r\nI recently spent time studying this passage to see it’s parallel to salvation. In preaching the gospel, we must have a starting point. The starting point is crucial to the outcome of the message. The gospel message that starts with man will ultimately put God on the stand and judge Him as the bad one. The gospel message that starts with God will definitely put man on the stand, this is the way it should be.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTo make this message clear, I draw our attention to <strong>1Samuel 9</strong> where we are told of Saul. In vs. 1 we meet his father, followed by who Saul was and his stature. In vs.3 we learn of an assignment given to him by his father which involved taking a servant on a journey. From vs. 4 onwards, he and his servant embark on a journey to find his father's lost donkeys. In vs. 5, indicates their unsuccessful journey which would push them to want to quit and go back home lest his father be worried of what became of him. In vs. 6 his servant came up with an idea, \"<strong>6 And he said to him, “Look now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he says surely comes to pass. So let us go there; perhaps he can show us the way that we should go.” …vs.\"10 Then Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was.\" </strong>Up to this point, you see moves made by Saul and his servant. It started with his father's request, their reasoning, and their quest to find these missing donkeys.\r\n\r\nIn vs. 15, the story takes a huge turn and changes everything, it says, <strong>\"15 Now the Lord <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">HAD</span> told Samuel in his ear <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">THE DAY BEFORE</span> Saul came, saying, 16 “TOMORROW ABOUT THIS TIME <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">I WILL</span> SEND YOU A MAN from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him commander over My people Israel...\". </strong>What amazes me in this story, the revelation of God is concealed until an appointed time. When the appointed time is revealed, it’s clear to us who was behind every move and every decision Saul made. God told Samuel a day before that He will send Saul. From the beginning it appeared Saul was orchestrating every plan and move, vs. 15 reveals that it was God at work. <strong>Philippians 2:13, “for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure</strong>”.\r\n\r\nJesus said to His disciples,<strong> “You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit…”, John 15:16. </strong>While it appears Saul chose to go and meet the prophet, it’s God who chose him and led him through circumstances to the right place. When I became a believer, it all started with me or as it appeared. I thought I was the one who got tired of living for self; I thought I was the one who began to have a desire for God. Now I know it was entirely the Lord’s doing, He put the desire, the drive, the repentance, and faith to believe in Him.\r\n\r\nWe did not choose God, God chose us. The Lord does the choosing, the saving, the keeping and He gets all the glory.

              "<strong>Ephesians 5:33, “Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband”</strong>\r\n\r\nOften times when we travel, we sometimes bring air mattress to sleep on. When the time to go to sleep comes, we blow it up until its firm then go to sleep. I have realized many times that in the middle of the night or by early morning when we wake up, the mattress that was firm when we went to sleep is no longer firm. The mattress feels wobbly and uncomfortable; very frustrating. The next day we look for holes to seal only to repeat the same cycle as we discover there are more holes in this mattress to seal.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe above analogy is a good example to what we encounter with marriages that start airtight, very firm only to find out down the road that it is not firm as it should be or how it was from the beginning. There are things leaking out leaving this thing called marriage wobbling in every direction. For the last few days, God has given my prayer partner and I a burden to pray for marriages, as there are many under <strong>silent frustrations</strong>. The smile is there on the outside but on the inside people are fed up, they feel pressure, very insecure, and resentful. The Love that was to keep their marriage airtight is silently leaking out day by day because there are things that are poking holes in it.\r\n\r\nWe see people who have been successful in building corporations; great CEO’s, manages successful corporations with thousands of employees but failed in one thing, marriage which involves two people. How will we stand when what we hoped and dreamed of is not what it became when we got there? In addition, where do we go from here? God must help us airtight our marriages to sleep through the nights and days.\r\n\r\n<strong>I believe God created marriage primarily to conform us to the image of Christ.</strong> This is to show us that it’s more than happiness. I know we are programmed to ask ourselves, “<i>what's in it for me, what will I gain out of it, how will it benefit me?”</i> but that’s the wrong order of things. It becomes easy to give when you have received, and no one finds it easy to be the first one to give when they feel the other person does not deserve it. When we encounter these roadblocks, what happens, we go through unending cycle of silent frustrations that leads nowhere and before long, it drives some to divorce.\r\n\r\nIt all begins with LOVE and RESPECT, <strong>Ephesians 5:22-33, vs. “Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband”</strong> Marriages are tough, we can’t make them work on our own. Like Mary and Joseph who received instructions from heaven as to how to raise baby Jesus, we too need instructions from heaven on how to grow and maintain love and respect in the light of what God has joined. My dad always says, “<em>Marriages are made in heaven, they are perfected here on earth</em>”. We have to be in God’s will, ready for change and ready to grow. I know not of any other place that I can grow more especially in my spiritual walk than in my God given marriage. May the Lord help us keep our marriages airtight. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Philippians 1:9-10, “9 And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">in knowledge and all discernment</span>, 10 that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6184\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nBiblical discernment is one of the most neglected areas of teaching in our churches, yet it is one of the most important areas to address especially if you want your flock to know, learn, approve, love and also protect themselves from wolves in sheep skins. In our time, some believers say, <strong>“</strong><em>we don’t want doctrine, doctrine divides and what divides does not cultivate love. We just want to love and worship Jesus</em><strong>” </strong>While this may sound very spiritual, it is not correct, <strong>to love and worship God does not devoid truth</strong>. Your mind (intellect) is not to be disengaged at all in worshipping God, <strong>Matthew 22:37, “Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your MIND”.</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->In continuing to talk about love<strong>, John 1:14</strong>, highlights GRACE and TRUTH side by side, <strong>vs. “14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of GRACE and TRUTH”. </strong>As Jesus talked to the woman at the well in <strong>John 4:21-24</strong>, Jesus highlighted the element of spirit (human spirit), the excitement to do something to be accompanied by truth otherwise it lacks backbone, <strong>vs. “24 God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”</strong> He did it with grace and truth.\r\n\r\nAnd here in <strong>Philippians 1:9-11</strong> Paul does the same in speaking of love and knowledge (truth) and all discernment. <strong>Vs. “9 And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment</strong>” As a proof of his great affection for them, he puts up this petition on their account; which supposes that they had love, since the good work of grace begun in them; for wherever the work of the Spirit of God is, there is love, which is a fruit of the Spirit. I believe he is praying that their love which was already there to abound more, the “more” here would be fueled by knowledge. Again both standing side by side so that their knowledge might be increased, and their discernment (judgment) in spiritual things be better informed and established. “<em>Some Christians are more affectionate, and less knowing; others are more knowing, and less affectionate;” </em>In missing the biblical knowledge, those who may be more affectionate than others find it easy to conclude that those who have knowledge and discernment, and apply spiritual maturity in many areas including resisting what is unbiblical are less or not loving. They may even want to say, “<em>if you love, you will not judge</em>”.\r\n\r\n<em>“It is well when love and knowledge go and keep pace together, that love is increased thereby, which is true; for the more saints know of God and Christ, the more they love and the more they know of one another's grace and experience, the more they love each other because of what Christ has done”, </em>John Gill<em>. </em>\r\n\r\nThe gospel message that centers on love and excludes truth is not the gospel of love at all and has no power. The person ready to receive the gospel is compared to the ground (soil) that is well prepared for planting. Jesus says, that is equivalent to \"...<strong>he who hears and understands the truth\", Matthew 13:23</strong>. The gospel must be rightly preached, rightly understood and rightly received, for there lies in the power of God because it is all TRUTH. <strong>Ephesians 1:13-14, “13 In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise”. </strong>We are not called to a blind faith.\r\n\r\nPaul shows what thing we ought to chiefly desire, that is, first of all that we may increase in the true knowledge of God so that we may be able to discern things that differ from one another, and also in love, that even to the end we may give ourselves to truly good works, to the glory of God by Jesus Christ. <strong>Ephesians 4:12-15, ”12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, 15 but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ—\", </strong>Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Timothy 4:3-4, “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away<em> their</em> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables”. </strong>\r\n\r\nThere is a great need for discernment in the 21ST century church. In the Pentecostal movement where souls are being added to the kingdom of God in thousands every day, there is a great need for INTEGRITY and CREDIBILITY demonstrated by pastors, preachers, teachers, prophets to mention a few. The reason for this is because as the Pentecostal movement continues to rise and great things are happening, we are also seeing a lot of damage being done in the name of Christianity and integrity and credibility are lacking in some of the lives of the individuals who call themselves Christians especially in the leadership arena. The integrity of the word is compromised through twist and manipulation of the word of God causing many to live in error and heresy.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAs born again believers we must have discernment (the ability to distinguish between right and wrong), especially when conditions are obscure, ambiguous or even misrepresented. Of all the things Solomon asked for when God gave him a blank check to ask for anything he wanted, he asked for wisdom to discern, <strong>1Kings 3:9, “Therefore give to Your servant an understanding (wisdom) heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil”. </strong>Three more scriptures to strengthen the discerning spirit, <strong>Ezekiel 44:23, Luke 12:56, and Hebrews 5:12-14</strong>. Why is discernment so key to our Christian lives? We want to live in TRUTH. <strong>John 8:32, \"And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” </strong>No one likes to be deceived by anyone, and what a tragedy it is when you discover you have been deceived just because you couldn't discern what was presented to you especially when you did not know the word. Eve was deceived because the serpent manipulated God's word and she could not discern, <strong>Genesis 3:1, “Now the serpent was more crafty ... He said to the woman, \"Did God REALLY say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?\" </strong>\r\n\r\nIn the light of too many preaching going on in our land, we have to be very careful what we feed to our spirit and mind because many of today’s preaching may appear sound until you apply wisdom that brings about discernment through the word of God you find that there may be SOME truths and a lot of errors, misinterpretation and manipulation that comes with it.\r\n\r\nFour areas where great discernment is needed are; 1. Discern <strong>CHARACTER</strong> over <strong>CHARISMA, </strong>2. Discern <strong>DOCTRINE</strong> over <strong>DECEPTION, </strong>3. Discern <strong>PROPHESY</strong> over <strong>PRESUMPTION, 4. </strong>Discern <strong>MIRACLES</strong> over <strong>MANIPULATION. </strong>I only have time to share on the first two.\r\n\r\n1. Discern <strong>CHARACTER</strong> over <strong>CHARISMA</strong>. A person of charisma could be a person with gifts, talents even good looks. Charisma appeals to the flesh. Remember Saul who was appointed king when the Israelites demanded for a king? They did not receive a king with character but a king with charisma to be like other nations, <strong>1Samuel 9:2, “And he had a choice and handsome son whose name was Saul. There was not a more handsome person than he among the children of Israel. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people”</strong>. Absalom the son of David was another man with charisma who tried to elevate himself. Is it not true today that we have many preachers with charisma (likeable, articulate, charming, good looking) but the big question is, do they have character? There is nothing wrong with Charisma yet Character should supersede charisma. Charisma can put anyone on top, Character will keep them there. In this age, many prefer what they like to hear rather than what they should hear<strong>. </strong>You know the end of Saul and Absalom. <strong>2Timothy 4:3-4, “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away<em> their</em> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables”. </strong>\r\n\r\n2. Discern <strong>DOCTRINE</strong> over <strong>DECEPTION. </strong>Paul addresses this with his spiritual son Timothy in <strong>1Timothy 4:1</strong> where he says <strong>“Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons</strong>” Which means, moving away from preaching the essential doctrines of Christianity and the whole counsel of God. Teachings appearing to be powerful but lacking the power fueled through the truth of God’s word. It's easy to catch something that is wide open, when you talk about deception, it's subtle, covered with some truths or may appear to be truth. Paul tells Timothy to be grounded in the word and teach the word, then says In vs. 6 “<strong>If you put these instructions before the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished on the words of the faith and of the sound teaching that you have followed (NRSV). </strong>Without discernment, many Christians are being led by doctrines that are not sound<strong>.</strong> Remember all teachings are judged by its agreement with the words of our Lord Jesus Christ. Read <strong>1Timothy 6</strong> and the entire <strong>2 Peter</strong> which are eye opening to discerning between Doctrine and Deception.

              "<strong>1Thessalonians 5:21-22, \"But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good; abstain from every form of evil\"</strong>\r\n\r\nA scripture often quoted in<strong> Matthew 7:1, </strong>says, <strong>\"Judge not, that you be not judged</strong>\" and this could be thought to mean being silent and receiving all things in the name of Christ asking no questions or else you may be labeled judgmental. The same chapter vs. 15, says, <strong>“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16 You will know them by their fruits\"</strong>. How can you then know false prophets without judging first? The One who said do not judge at the beginning is giving indication that it's ok to judge. I think the \"judge not\" is in reference to someone's salvation. There could be 101 clear signs suggesting someone is not saved, the ultimate judge of their souls is God. We can share the gospel and let them examine themselves to see if they are in the faith. The judging I am still addressing today is discernment, what is going into my system must be evaluated. I hate to be deceived, deception is lethal the reason we have to judge everything preached and said by the word of God.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of preaching and teachings out here especially coming from the West that must be received with a lot of discernment. As <strong>Pastor Gregg Johnson </strong>(my pastor) previously shared on the “Need For Discernment” preached along those lines where in Africa the west is influencing their Christianity, there are four areas he preached on that I present to you again because they are very important. As believers, we must be very careful on what we feed our spirit and mind because many of today’s preaching may appear sound, but if you applying discernment through the word of God, you will find that there are alot of errors buried in SOME truths that must be exposed if you are to overcome deception in your life. You will also find alot of misinterpretation and manipulation that comes with it. Four areas where great discernment is needed are. <em>1. Discern </em><strong><em>CHARACTER</em></strong><em> over </em><strong><em>CHARISMA, </em></strong><em>2. Discern </em><strong><em>DOCTRINE</em></strong><em> over </em><strong><em>DECEPTION, </em></strong><em>3. Discern </em><strong><em>PROPHESY</em></strong><em> over </em><strong><em>PRESUMPTION, 4. </em></strong><em>Discern </em><strong><em>MIRACLES</em></strong><em> over </em><strong><em>MANIPULATION</em>.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat is discernment and why is this important<strong><em>? </em>Pastor John MacArthur </strong>shares with us on this<em>, </em><strong><em>\"</em></strong><em>In its simplest definition, discernment is nothing more than the ability to decide between truth and error, right and wrong. Discernment is the process of making careful distinctions in our thinking about truth. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>1</em><strong><em>Thessalonians 5:21-22 teaches that it is the responsibility of every Christian to be discerning: \"But examine everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good; abstain from every form of evil.\"</em></strong><em> The apostle John issues a similar warning when he says, </em><strong><em>\"Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world\" (1John 4:1)</em></strong><em>. </em><strong><em>According to the New Testament, discernment is not optional for the believer-it is required. </em></strong>\r\n<em>The key to living an uncompromising life lies in one's ability to exercise discernment in every area of his or her life. For example, failure to distinguish between truth and error leaves the Christian subject to all manner of false teaching. False teaching then leads to an unbiblical mindset, which results in unfruitful and disobedient living--a certain recipe for compromise. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>Unfortunately, discernment is an area where most Christians stumble. They exhibit little ability to measure the things they are taught against the infallible standard of God's Word, and they unwittingly engage in all kinds of unbiblical decision-making and behavior. In short, they are not armed to take a decidedly biblical stand against the onslaught of unbiblical thinking and attitudes that face them throughout their day. </em>\r\n\r\n<em>Discernment intersects the Christian life at every point. And God's Word provides us with the needed discernment about every issue of life. According to Peter</em><strong><em>, God \"has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence\" ( 2Peter 1:3).</em></strong><em> You see, it is through the\"true knowledge of Him,\" that we have been given everything we need to live a Christian life in this fallen world. And how else do we have true knowledge of God but through the pages of His Word, the Bible? In fact, Peter goes on to say that such knowledge comes through God's granting\"</em><strong><em>to us His precious and magnificent promises\" (2Peter 1:4). </em></strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Discernment-the ability to think biblically about all areas of life-is indispensable to an uncompromising life. It is incumbent upon the Christian to seize upon the discernment that God has provided for in His precious truth! Without it, Christians are at risk of being\"tossed here and there by waves, and carried about by every wind of doctrine\" (</em><strong><em>Ephesians 4:14</em></strong><em>).\"</em>\r\n\r\nIf you value sound doctrine, then be like the Bereans, <strong>Acts 17:10-11, \"10 Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. 11 These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so</strong>.\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/05/02/need-for-discernment-inspired-by-pastor-gregg-johnson/\" target=\"_blank\">Need For Discernment, Inspired by Pastor Gregg Johnson</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/05/02/love-does-not-exclude-truth-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Love Does Not Exclude Truth, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Psalm 18:34, “He teaches my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms”.\r\n</strong>\r\nMy dad was one you would call a handy man. If it was broken then my dad would fix it. As a matter of fact he had been known to create very unique ways of fixing things or building things. I recall that he always tried to build things strong and solid to keep things lasting long. However when he was a young boy he didn’t know how to use his hands in this regards, he had to learn it. One moves from not knowing to knowing through learning, and he learned to use his hands from his dad.\r\n<!--more-->\r\nDavid wrote, He [God] teaches my hands to war…”\r\n\r\n1. <strong>Warrior Engage in War</strong>\r\n\r\nDavid was a warrior from his youth. As a young boy he said <b>“35 t</b><strong>here came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: 35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 36 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear…</strong>” Of course David defeated the famous Goliath as well. The Lord seemed to teach David’s hands to war. David would become a military leader in Saul’s Army. As Christians we are in the Kings army and there is certainly a war at hand, one that is not of flesh and blood, but one against rulers, principalities and powers of darkness.\r\n\r\n2. <strong>Warriors have hands of war “He teaches my hands to war.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s not enough to dress for battle and admire ones armor in front of a mirror. <strong>Ephesians 6</strong> also tells us after one has put on the full armor of God to take a stand against the Devil’s schemes, the warrior must battle in prayer (<strong>Ephesians 6:18 – 19</strong>). Open your mouth boldly, Make known the mystery of the Gospel, Pray always with all prayer in the Spirit, Pray with supplication in the Spirit, Watch with perseverance – Jesus said in the Garden of Gethsemane, “<strong>watch and pray…</strong>” Make supplication for the saints (fellow believers, not dead people), Pray for laborers <b>(Matthew 9:36-37)</b>\r\n\r\n3. <b>Warriors make breakthroughs </b>“…<strong>a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.”</strong>\r\n\r\nNot everyone in the military is considered a warrior. One prerequisite one needs to be considered a warrior is the fact that warriors have won some significant battles that could have been lost. We think of warriors winning many more times than losing. David wrote that he broke a bow of steel in my hands. <strong>Acts 12:5</strong> states, “<strong>So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.</strong>” Then something happened, Peter actually was broken free from jail by an angel of the Lord (<strong>Acts 12:6–16</strong>). Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, \"<strong>thy will be done,</strong>” then He went to the cross and put “legs” to his prayers. Don’t just pray for the saints, “encourage them as well,” don’t just pray for the unsaved, go out and reach the lost by preaching the gospel the way Jesus did. If we are warriors for Christ, breakthroughs MUST take place. Learn how to engage in war through prayer, and as one prays in the will of God, one should experience breakthroughs as the church did in Acts. Are you a warrior? If you feel you have been engaged in the spiritual war at hand are you experiencing breakthroughs? Engage, fight, pray, do, and breakthrough by the power and will of God! Blessings, Phil the Evangelist"

              "<strong>Matthew 7:11, \"If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!”</strong>\r\n\r\nOur lives can never be complete without God being part of it. In as much as it’s easy to run around thinking that your life is complete, the truth of the matter is, you need a bigger hand and a bigger mind to guide, provide, protect, and lead you whichever way you go. As the children of God, we pray for a hand bigger than ours to guide and direct us to the safe harbor.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nCalling on God ought to be our first priority and not our last option. Often we find that we panic first which leads to fear that leaves us disoriented. It is easy to assume that God will just handle what you are dealing with. Yes there are times He will do things without us even calling on Him and there are times we would be required to call on Him.\r\n\r\nKing Hezekiah, a God fearing king was sick, he received a message from God by Prophet Isaiah that he was not going to live. The first thing he did was not fear or panic, he went straight into the house of the Lord to cry out to Him (intercede). He desired to live and with that he had to do something about it. He understood that prayer changes things and therefore he did not want to conclude that there was nothing that could happen if he prayed. <strong>2Kings 20:2-3, \"2 Then he turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD, saying, 3″Remember now, O LORD, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done what was good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly”</strong>. When you feel it’s too late to bring it before God, that could be the right time it needed to be brought to the Lord. In my case I would have thought, a prophet has spoken, it is a message from God, this is it, let me pack my bags and wait for my time to go. Not with Hezekiah, he was not ready to go easily, he still needed a bigger hand in his situation. A hand that was able to reverse the sentence. It was not a hand that “would” but a hand that was “able”, big difference. “Would” means you definitely know what He will do, “Able” means, you know He can and the outcome is in His hands.\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 7:-11, \"7 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent? 11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!”</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen we cry out to God, heaven goes in motion while hell goes in chaos. It is like a telegram sent to the throne room of God, and God goes to work with His angels because He has promised to fulfill His word. Prayer changes how heaven responds, it moves things on top of the list of the agendas. Hezekiah’s prayer was like a telegram so was Daniel’s prayer, answers were released immediately because Prayer changes things. Do you believe that your prayers to God could change a situation? Do you call on Him first as a priority or call on Him as the last option? To add the most important part in all this,<strong> prayer does more than change things, prayer changes us</strong>.

              "In <strong>Luke chapter 22 verse 31</strong>.We read of Jesus warning Peter of a danger that lay ahead of him. He told him “<strong>Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded permission to sift you like wheat; but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, strengthen your brothers</strong>.” We all know that Peter denied the Lord three times that very night. In verse 34, we read that Jesus told Peter,<strong> “I say to you, Peter, the cock will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.</strong>” Does God allow failure? Does He permit it? Is there a purpose in failure? Or is failure something that has no purpose at all in God’s perfect will and something that God cannot use to further his purposes!<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhen we read this passage, we see that God did not prevent Peter from denying Him. Why didn’t Jesus say “<em>Simon I have prayed for you that you will not deny Me even once.</em>” Why did the Lord pray only that Peter’s faith may not fail, even if Peter himself fell?? Isn’t it interesting that the Lord did not pray that Peter might not fall? Some of us would like the Lord to pray for us that we might never fall. We would like the Lord to say to us “<em>My son, my daughter, I have prayed for you that you will never fall and never fail.</em>” But interestingly enough, our Lord doesn’t pray such a prayer for us. What did Jesus pray for Simon? That when Satan tempted him, his faith would not fail. He didn’t pray that Peter should not fall in temptation, but that when he did fall, his faith in God’s perfect love would not fail him – so that even when Peter reached the bottom of the pit of failure, he would confess, “God still loves me”. That is faith – and that is the confession we must always have on our lips and in our hearts – no matter how low we may have sunk or fallen – that God still loves us, JUST AS WE ARE. That was the confession of the prodigal son. When he had reached so low that he could not go any lower, he still believed that his father loved him. I can’t imagine anyone reaching any lower than the prodigal son had reached – eating what the pigs ate. That boy was at rock-bottom. But when he reached rock-bottom, he remembered one thing: That his father still loved him. Otherwise he would never have returned home. Supposing he’d heard that his father had died and that his elder brother was now running the house, do you think he would have come back home? No. He knew what his elder brother was like. And knowing that, he would never have come back.\r\n\r\nThere’s hope for all who’ve failed thoroughly, who’ve made a mess of their lives, and who’ve reached rock bottom. From there the Lord can pick you up and take you to the heights of glory. His prayer for us is that our faith in God’s love should not fail at any time. When you hit rock bottom, remember one thing that God still loves you, no matter where you are, or how low you have fallen. May your faith in God’s love not fail in that hour.\r\n\r\nIt was with a purpose that God allowed Peter to fail. That purpose was to sift Peter. What Satan really wanted was to destroy Peter altogether, but God would not allow him to do that. God does not allow us to be tested or tried beyond our ability. So Satan was allowed to sift Peter. As a result of his failure, Peter was cleansed of a whole lot of chaff in his life. That is the real purpose with which God allows us to fail too. Isn’t it a good thing for the chaff to be removed from our lives? Certainly. When a farmer harvests the wheat, he has to sift it before he can use it. Only then will the chaff be removed from it.\r\n\r\nThe Lord uses Satan to remove the chaff from our lives. Amazingly enough, God accomplishes this purpose by allowing us to fail repeatedly!! God used Satan to fulfill that purpose in Peter and He will use Satan to fulfill that purpose in our lives too. There’s a lot of chaff in all of us – the chaff of pride, self-confidence and self-righteousness. And God uses Satan to make us fail repeatedly, in order to remove that chaff from us completely. Whether the Lord is succeeding in fulfilling this purpose in your life or not, you alone know. But if the chaff is being removed, you will be humbler and less self-righteous. You won’t look down on others who fail. You won’t consider yourself better than anyone else. As I said, God permits Satan to remove the chaff from us, by allowing us to fail repeatedly. So don’t get discouraged if you fail. You are still in God’s hand. There is a glorious purpose that’s being fulfilled through your repeated failures. But your faith in God’s love for you must not fail at such times.\r\n\r\nThat was what Jesus prayed for Peter and what He’s praying for us today. He’s not praying that we may never fail, but He’s praying that when we do reach rock-bottom, our confidence in God’s love will still be unshaken. Only through many experiences of failure do we finally reach a “zero point”, where we’re truly broken. It was when Peter reached that point, that he had a second “conversion” (Lk.22:32 – KJV). He turned around. The proof that Jesus’ prayer for Peter was answered is seen in the fact that when Peter hit rock-bottom, he turned around. He didn’t just lie down there discouraged. He didn’t lose his faith. He got up. God had let him go on a long leash. But when Peter reached the end of that rope, God pulled him back. It’s a wonderful thing to be a child of God. When God lays hold of us, He puts a rope around us to protect us. There’s a lot of slack in that rope, and you may slip up and fall many thousands of times and even drift away from the Lord. But one day, you’ll reach the end of that rope. And then God will pull you right back to Him. Of course, you can decide at that point, to cut off the rope and run away. Or you can choose to be broken by God’s kindness and mourn and return to Him. That’s what Peter did. He wept and turned back to the Lord. But Judas Iscariot didn’t do that. He cut away the rope – in rebellion against God’s authority over his life – and was eternally lost. But I trust you’ll do what Peter did. Jesus then told Peter, “<strong>When you turn back and are strong once again, strengthen your brothers</strong> “. It is only when we are broken that we can be strong enough to strengthen others. It was only when Peter was weak and broken, that he became really strong – so strong that he was able to strengthen his brothers and sisters. We could say that Peter’s preparation for Spirit-filled service came through his experience of failure. If he had been filled with the Holy Spirit, without this experience of failure, he would have stood up on the day of Pentecost as a proud man, as a man who had never failed, who could look down despisingly at the poor lost sinners in front of him. And God would have become his enemy, for God resists the proud!! Blessings"

              "<strong>1Peter 1:16-, \"Because it is written, “Be ye holy, for I am holy.”</strong>\r\n\r\nHoliness is the very essence and nature of God. It is the description of who He is. Time and time again, both in the Old and New Testament, God is proclaimed as holy, both by men and angels, all of His creation declares His holiness. Here, God speaks through the anointed word of Peter, declaring a truth that is as pertinent in the New testament as it was in the Old Testament, we are to be holy, for He is holy. This is what God demands of His people. This is not an option, just as sin is not an option. We are to forsake sin, and to be holy, partakers of the very divine nature of God.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that holiness is the most ignored teaching in our time. What was once the common condition of a Christian has now been relegated to nothing more than a passing thought. But look deeper now, who does Jesus say will see God? The pure in heart (<strong>Matthew 5:8</strong>). What does Hebrews tell us, that without holiness, no one shall see the Lord (<strong>Hebrews 12:14</strong>). What has become an afterthought in modern “Christendom” has always been the central focus of Christianity, a pure and holy heart. Think of it, would an earthly king be made to dwell in the midst of filthiness? not at all. They are secured in the finest of everything, comforts of life we can’t even imagine. Yet we expect the King of Glory to come and live within a filthy heart, filled with idolatry, pride, anger, and all other sorts.\r\n\r\nGod sent His Son to make us holy, to cleanse us of our inner corruption, that He may reign within us in glorious beauty and splendor. Does He deserve any less? So the question is, am I holy as He is holy? Or am I in love with the world, am I too fascinated with sport and entertainment, the devil’s best friends, to even give God the time of day? Is my heart truly the holy habitation of God? Does my heart belong fully to Him? Is Jesus the central focus of my life, the center of my affections, or do I give Him fifteen minutes a few times a week? When you fell in love with your spouse, remember how much time you spent with them. You couldn’t wait to see them each day. Do you feel that way about Jesus? God is a jealous God, He desires all of us, and He desires holiness. Seek for Him until you find Him friends, till He fills every part of your life.\r\n\r\nThat our hearts may be stirred, Blessings Brother Ben"

              "<p><strong>Luke 21:1-4, “1 Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box, 2 and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. 3 And he said, “Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them. 4 For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.” </strong></p><p>When I went to the jewelers I was looking at some rings for my wife. The Jeweler explained to me the four C's to look for when looking at a diamond. The Jeweler looks at the <strong>C</strong>arat weight, diamond <strong>C</strong>olor, <strong>C</strong>ut, and <strong>C</strong>larity. However, when I look at a diamond I usually see the <strong>S</strong>hape, and the <strong>S</strong>hine, oh and the <strong>S</strong>acrifice (aka the cost). Although myself and my Jeweler look at the same ring, we see different things. I see my three S's and he sees his four C's. He looks through a magnifying glass, and his judgment is aligned with the standards of the properly rating diamonds, and that determines the price. The reality of looking at the exact same thing, but seeing two different things applies to jewelry, and perhaps almost any given field of discipline.<!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--></p><p><!--more--><!--more-->Jesus had spoken to the Sadducees and left them feeling foolish when they could not catch Jesus in their foolish questions. Jesus speaks to His disciples, in the presence of both the people at the temple, as well as the Sadducees concerning the giving of offerings in the treasury at the temple. Everyone saw the same thing, a poor widow putting in two copper coins, and rich men placing their gifts into the offering box. Both the people and Jesus saw the giving of the offerings, but both saw with very different eyes. Luke writes that the scribes we're those \"who devour widows’ houses.\" The IVP NT Commentary states, \"<em>Widows had little means of support, were socially powerless and were to be protected under Jewish law. Jesus could mean that these teachers exploit widows’ resources by seeking extensive tithes (which they could set at 20–30 percent, on top of the heavy land taxes levied by the government); or he could mean that they follow the letter of the law in legal decisions, rather than showing mercy to the poor as the law required</em>.\". Jesus often had a way of explaining how the last would be first in the kingdom of God, and showing how the most despised of society that truly tried to honor God were those God would exalt, as the prideful religious leaders would lift themselves up, and put others down. Jesus commended the poor widow saying, \"<strong>For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on</strong>.” The Greek expression signifies extreme poverty. The smallest copper coins in use in Palestine, worth about one-eighth of a cent, but representing her total livelihood, hence all she had to live on. Yet what she deposits Jesus exalts, and He is the only One that saw this as pleasing to God, as opposed to everyone else that measured in certain amounts. How is the amount the widow offered going to make a bit of difference? This woman was desperately poor, she was more fit to be a recipient of charity than a donor mites (MacArthur Study Bible). It made a difference to the One in whom the money was supposed to be a blessing toward, God Himself. It was the God man Christ Jesus that it made a difference to. Peter and James both wrote, \"<strong>God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble</strong>.\"</p><p>Christ sees through His holy lens that which pleases Him. He gets pleasure in seeing what pleases Him, and not what pleases man. Paul wrote, \"<strong>For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ</strong>. Serve the Lord with that which pleases Him. To find out what pleases Him look to His Word, and bath your decisions in prayer by the Word of God.</p><p>Until the nets are filled...</p><p>Blessings, Phil, the evangelist &lt;&gt;&lt;</p>"

Imagine if we don’t start preparing our children for life, how will they make it when the time comes? If you prepared them, they may not like you now but eventually appreciate you. If someone is sick, the medicine they need to cure them might not taste or feel good but it’s effective. Therefore, some of the devotionals may not taste sweet but God is using them to cure, grow and prepare us for the things to come. Life is not fair but God is good. Praise His name.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 8:31, “What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</strong> This is the end result that should always ring in our minds and hearts as believers. Look at where Paul puts the vs. at 31, and then follows with hard truths in vs. 35.\r\n\r\nWe are in a fast forward mentality era. By this I mean we want everything either ready or can be ready in a short time (the microwave generation). We are in a hurry and can’t wait to make the next move, if we could get rid of patience we would. The mentality we have, my way or no way, or like burger king, “have it your way” (sad but true), trickles down to relationships and marriages. Easy come, easy go and so are many marriages today, the Hollywood style. People are in a hurry to be in relationships and also in a hurry to be in marriage. We love convenient things even when it asks for more. We are in a hurry to get new appliances to work without reading instructions. In a hurry to sign a contract, get a promotion, and even in a hurry to be used of God. The same drive we had before salvation we find it still very present even after we get saved. Things are not happening fast as they should or as they were anticipated. Someone received a word from the Lord that He was going to do something, they find that they can’t wait to see the Lord do it, constantly checking, being anxious as though the Lord forgot His word. Kids are in a hurry to grow and can’t wait to be adults. We are all guilty at some point of being in a hurry to do something or be in something. The problem of being in a hurry, many times it does more damage than good. Hurrying does not allow you to look before you leap to see if that is the path you want to follow and if you are ready to take it no matter the cost. The Bible says, “<strong>He who is going to build must first count the cost”</strong> and this is not the case in our time. There are a lot of exits on the highway in our days so that if we don’t like it anymore, we don’t have to struggle to work on it, just take the next exit.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that does damage apart from hurrying is the order of affection, for example; being interested in what someone else has rather than what you have. The problem with this is that things can easily come and go, whereas people and values last. I have seen people leave because what they based their relationship on was no more. Last but not least, the Bible puts emphasis on Soul, Spirit, and Body, man has changed it to body, soul, and spirit. God is the lover of my soul. It doesn’t matter what I look like, God loves my soul first. Today body gets the first priority and we know the body is always in a hurry. I believe the order of the affection has a way of affecting us in this life and we need to be very careful not to put emphasis on the wrong thing. Having set the ground for sharing, I will dig into this passage in the next message. blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 8:35&amp;36, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, vs. 36 As it is written “For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn my continuous study of God’s word, I am utterly convinced (persuaded) that God is not in a hurry. To prove it, read about Moses, Elisha, David, Paul, Gideon, Samuel, Eli and many in the bible that encountered with God. We need to get saved because tomorrow is promised to no one, the walk after salvation requires patience. Patience is accompanied by endurance. Paul writes in <strong>Romans 12:2, “Run this race with patience looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith“.</strong> He was persuaded that God was not in a hurry to do things. God is such a Master craftsman working on what He has started step by step. If you watch a potter working on clay, you will notice that he is not in hurry to finish working on whatever he is working on until it looks perfect. Be patient with God, He is not in a hurry.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf there is any man who counted the cost of living for Christ it was Paul. Remember that Paul did not physically walk with Jesus like the other disciples. He was not there when Jesus started His ministry, when He chose His disciples, when He taught the people, or healed and provided for them. Paul was not there when He was transfigured, not even when they took Him, whipped Him and later nailed Him on the cross. Paul was not there when they buried Him and then came back to life on the third day. And Paul was not there when He ascended to the heavens. Regardless of missing all that, Paul is and will be there when He calls the justified. This started when he encountered with the truth while on his way to Damascus to persecute Christians. What he experienced that day persuaded him of the truth and with the calling, he purposed in his heart to live and serve Christ. This is a man who counted the cost yet he wasn't there like the rest of the disciples to see Him face to face.\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 8:35&amp;36, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword\" </strong> A man who is not in a hurry to leave will be conformed to the image of Christ. Think of the life of Paul, many times he was beaten, stoned and left for dead, he survived shipwrecks, imprisoned, made fun of, ridiculed but he had been persuaded that he was on the right track. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Have you ever asked yourself that question? The “who” here is not just referring to people but situations too. It’s like saying, \"<em>I have made up my mind to stay on this road come rain or sunshine, come hell or high water, I am going to stick with this road. It has hills and valleys, pot holes, what shall separate me from this love that I have attained? This means what I am dealing with cannot be compared to the love that He has bestowed upon me</em>\". If you are on death row and your time has come to be executed and someone appears from nowhere and says, “Let me be executed in your place“. Your question to him might be, “why are doing this?”, and if he responded by saying, “because I love you,” wouldn’t that change everything in your life?\r\n\r\nPaul is now writing to us and asking us, what shall make us take an exit? shall it be all those things he has written of among others? In countries like China there are many people dying for their faith, the love of Christ compels them to stand. And this is because they are persuaded/ convinced that Jesus Christ is the only way and that He is love. The word persuaded means to take time to learn and experience it, patience is the word for it. Persuaded is to induce to believe by appealing to reason or understanding. God has persuaded us in His word that He loves us, He demonstrated by sacrificing His son on the cross for us, He has persuaded us that He can be trusted and continues to. Persuasion is not for hurried people, it’s for people who want to know more and live connected regardless of what happens, God’s word continues to convince them. To continue, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 8:35&amp;36, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, vs. 36 As it is written “For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter”</strong>\r\n\r\nWe concluded our devotion with this thought, “Persuasion is not for hurried people but people who want to know more and live connected regardless”\r\n\r\nTwo things to bring to us from <strong>Romans 8</strong> concerning the question asked by Paul about who shall separate us, the <strong>natural</strong> and the <strong>supernatural</strong>. Looking at verse 35&amp;36, you can see that he is referring to the natural (tribulation, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, and sword) and then he concludes it by saying that for His sake we are killed all day long. I would take this to mean, in the process of dying to self and crucifying the flesh, we face these things that have separated many from God's love but we are compelled to love Him because He loved us first. We know that His love is better than life and in turn we are telling Him that our love for Him is better than whatever thing we go through therefore we would rather suffer and die to these things than loose our love for Him.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 8:37, “Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us”.</strong> We need to understand that even though we have made a choice to love Him in spite of, these things we are dealing with will still be painful, yet we are reminded that we are more than conquerors. Being more than a conqueror is conquering what God has already conquered. He has conquered for us because He loves us and we have refused to be separated because we love Him. With this understanding, Paul goes far ahead to say, the natural will not separate him and so is the supernatural.<strong> Romans 8:35&amp;36, “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword, vs. 36 As it is written “For Your sake we are killed all day long; We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter” </strong>These two verses addresses what we face in the natural, then the next verse addresses what we face in the supernatural, <strong>Romans 8:38, “For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come vs. 39, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord”</strong> <strong>yet in all these we are more than conqueror both in the natural and the supernatural because of Him\"\r\n</strong>\r\nLooking at it closely, I can see a love reciprocated, <strong>Romans 5:8, “But God demonstrated His love, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us</strong>“, then Paul responds to this love by saying,<strong> “Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?”</strong>, Paul concludes, <strong>“I am persuaded that the natural and the supernatural will not stop me from His love,”.</strong> Listen to what Paul says again in <strong>2Timothy 1:12, “For this reason I also suffer these things; nevertheless I am not a shamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day“</strong>. Read Paul’s story and you will discover that everything he mentioned he experienced but none of them separated him from His love and it’s all because He was persuaded in every minute in his life that Christ sure loved him. If you are facing some challenges mentioned above and doubting Christ’s love for you, look to the cross where He demonstrated His own love by dying for you. This should be your point of encouragement to believe that He knows where you are and where you are going. You have to be persuaded that you are in His will and be a conqueror in every state in natural or supernatural even when you don’t see it or feel it. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Ephesians 2:8-, \"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,\"</strong>\n\nHere the inspired apostle gives a simple formula for salvation; by grace, through faith. Not by grace alone, nor by faith alone, but these working together to bring the soul into harmony with God. It is only through the shed blood of Jesus that we can be saved, He alone is the author of salvation. No man can earn this, no amount of good can cleanse us, only the precious blood of Jesus. God has prepared for all mankind the means of salvation.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nBut what of faith? This is our part, and the part often most ignored. We receive by His grace the ability to believe, but the act of faith whereby we trust in Jesus for salvation is ours. God does not forcibly save anyone, nor does He keep us against our will, He allows us a free will, for He desires a people that truly love Him, and obey Him out of this love. In the Greek language, the word faith throughout the NT depicts an ongoing action, present tense word. We do not one time put our faith in Jesus, but we daily live by faith, pursuing a holy life, forsaking all sin, enabled continually by His grace. This does not just happen automatically, it is a daily walk by faith, for the just shall live by faith. God alone saves, He alone sanctifies, but we must take the initiative, we must be diligent to maintain our part.\n\nWe must daily work out our salvation with fear and trembling, all the while knowing it is God who works in us. God will not do for us what He has commanded us to do, He will not force us to walk in His ways, nor will He overlook our sin, but He will give us the ability we need to overcome sin as we yield our lives to Him. We cannot neglect our responsibility, neglecting to care for our physical body results in death the same way neglecting the spiritual responsibilities results in spiritual death and backsliding. If you hear His voice, harden not your hearts, for God is truly desiring to do a work in each of our lives, he desires that we would be holy as He is holy, that Christ would be formed within us, His very righteousness, not merely imputed to us, but imparted within us, this is the ongoing work of salvation in our lives as we remain in Christ. Let us look unto Jesus, the author and finisher, the originator and perfector, of our faith.\n\nAll for the glory of His wonderful Name, blessings Brother Ben"

              "Life has many obstacles. We all face them every day. The obstacles hinder us from being where we are supposed to be or want to be. Overcoming obstacles of any kind is not easy, especially when you are trying on your own. Naturally, as human beings, we have limited power, strength, knowledge, abilities, and many other resources that can and should be used to overcome obstacles.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThere are many ways and approaches that have been advanced by professionals, philosophers, or even lay people throughout all generations for dealing with obstacles in life. To some extent, some people have overcome great obstacles in their personal life using their own ways, methods, or even tactics and strategies. Many have also failed and some have even died without experiencing any breakthroughs with their life’s obstacles. And even today, there are countless peoples who are trapped and have been stopped from moving any further because they face insurmountable obstacles that they cannot go through or past. Such people need help! I HAPPEN TO BE AMONG THOSE THAT NEED HELP. Do you?\r\n\r\nWELL, I do not know what your answer to that question is; I also do not know what your situation is either. But I do know that if you are like all of us, living here on earth, where there are countless problems and challenges that people face every day, then you need help. And help is available!\r\n\r\nThere is an enemy- a common enemy of mankind who is busy building obstacles: gates, walls etc to stop you and I from experiencing the victorious and abundant life God meant for all of us. We are all God’s creation. We were created, formed and made by God for a purpose greater than ourselves, and with unlimited potential to become anything He wanted us to be. But mankind lost it through wrong choice. Choosing to be independent, and live a life of self without God. This deviation from God’s plan is one reason we have problems, difficulties and obstacles we cannot overcome on our own. It is also the reason why we are cached and limited and powerless, so that we cannot live victorious lives.\r\n\r\nI would like to share with you some insights and strategies that you can use as a Christian to help you overcome any obstacle you may be facing right now or in the future. Here are some Seven Strategies for Overcoming Obstacles.\r\n\r\n1. Plow Through the obstacle:\r\n2. Go round it:\r\n3. Climb over it:\r\n4. Change the route:\r\n5. Re-position yourself:\r\n6. Review the situation:\r\n7. Break the obstacle in pieces and deal with the pieces one by one.\r\n\r\nTo continue, Have a great day. Blessings Bro Boaz"

              "There are seven strategies or approaches to dealing with obstacles that I would like to share. They are not the only ones, nor are they the super strategies for overcoming all of life’s obstacles we face daily. <strong>But they are good and godly, and are time tested, as the Bible will prove and as some of us will confirm from our testimonies and past experiences and victories God have given us. I will begin today by examining the first strategy or approach:<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Plowing Through The Obstacle, </strong>When faced with an obstacle, small or big, our common reaction is usually a response or a reaction. Reaction seems to be the option most of us prefer because, I guess, it is cheap since no much thought or consideration or concentration or efforts are necessary. For instance, if you are facing a disappointment as an obstacle, you can simply deal with it by deciding to give up or quit or cry afoul or curse. Worse, you can choose to sink and drown in the deep ocean of depression, where hopelessness and frustration are manifested in large quantity free of charge. Now that’s very dangerous, because most people don’t get out of that sea senile or at, worse, a live. You know that. Don’t you? Try not to be a statistic. Don’t go there.\r\n\r\nBut what about “response” to an obstacle? I mean in a positive manner that is likely to produce the best and most desirable and victorious result? That may demand a lot more than any reactions I have already mentioned. It may mean making a conscious decision, however risky or painful or hard or challenging the obstacle may be, that you are going to “plow” right through it. Your choices and decisions determine the outcome. Your dependence on God for help guarantees the victory, which is usually accompanied by a lot of joy and celebrations. Listen to what the Psalmist wrote: <strong><em>“ Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy comes in the morning (Psalms 30:5). </em></strong>\r\n\r\nThere is a morning that always comes for those who decide to go through their obstacle, even when they are weeping so hard. They know that the weeping is just but for a night. Don't let Satan lie to you that your obstacle is unique and special, just newly invented and that you do not have the ability and capacity to overcome it. Our God is able. His specialty is deliverance. His presence alone, even without doing anything or saying anything, melts any obstacle or problem. He is also a good road constructor. He makes ways where roads never existed and no Engineer could ever imagine a road could be constructed. Come with me to the Bank of the Red Sea and see how He did that to Moses and the children of Israel, when they faced the impossible to “plow” through -The Red Sea. Read Exodus 14, and see what God can do. It records one of the most spectacular and incredible miracle of victory over and a gigantic and life threatening obstacle. <strong>The first thing God said to the Israelites was “ stand still” and see my “ salvation which I am going to show you today.”</strong> In other words, don’t panic or be scared. I am with you and I am in control of the situation. The reality was they were scared to death, because Pharaoh's soldiers were behind them ready to kill them or recapture them and take them the back to slavery and the Red Sea was in front of them. Now, look, these guys were in a” fix”. But God was not scared! <strong>Anytime you face an obstacle, stand still. You will see God’s hand and power melting your problems, fears, doubts, and all those things that are frustrating you and causing pain and at the same time stopping you from reaching your maximum potential God intended for you.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>The second thing God did was “He told Moses to stretch his rod over the Red Sea, and divide the sea.”</strong> A dry way opened up right before their eyes and they were commanded to walk through it to the other side. Wow! What a miracle! <strong>You see, God gave Moses an idea and a plan for overcoming the impossible. He acted on them and they worked. You too need a plan and an idea from God for overcoming. You can thrive on God’s ideas, thoughts, plans and wisdom.</strong> Seek them from His word. You will never overcome successfully on your own, no matter how much you try. If you don’t want to drown and die, then you must decide to dedicate yourself to God and depend on Him absolutely without if, or, but, or maybe etc. If you want to sing today and have a happy celebration, then make a decision to go through any of your present or future obstacles with God. <strong>Use what you have to make what you need happen. </strong>\r\n\r\nAfter the Israelites plowed through their obstacle, they sang a song of praise and worship to God. Praise and worship are inevitable, when facing obstacles, and after victory is won. <strong><em>“Then sang Moses and the children of Israel unto the Lord this song, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously…” Exodus 15:1</em></strong>\r\n\r\nRead the rest of the song for yourself. <strong>You really need to read, later on if you can’t now these two chapters from Bible.</strong> With open heart and willingness to learn, hear from God, and adopt the lessons or strategies revealed, your life will never be the same again.\r\n\r\n<strong>Let us pray</strong>: Our father in Heaven, we thank you for being there for us when we don’t know what to do. We ask you to help us face our obstacles with courage and trust in your power, for victory and deliverance, whenever we face an obstacle. In Jesus name. Amen Boaz"

              "<strong>“ And the Lord said to Joshua, see, I have given into your hand Jericho…and you shall compass the city…and go round about the city once. this you will do six days, and you shall compass the city seven times…” Joshua 6:2-3, 5.</strong>\r\n\r\nWe shared on <strong>Plowing through the obstacles</strong>, this morning he will be sharing on <strong>Going Round the obstacles</strong> as we continue to learn how to overcome life obstacles.\r\n\r\nOur main text, from the Bible, is found in the book of <strong>Joshua 6: 1-27.</strong> I recommend that you read the whole chapter, after work, quietly and meditate on it. God will reveal more great things to you.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFirst, let me say that in life, there are obstacles that will not be easily plowed through or problems that will be solved quickly or instantly. But they can be solved and will be resolved, if the right strategy or approach is used. In most cases, a great deal of spiritual weapons and personal qualities or virtues are necessary for overcoming deeply rooted, and tough to move, change or plow through. One of these virtues that anybody hopping to go the long haul with an obstacle is: <strong>Patience</strong>. Let me repeat it: Patieeeeeeeence! Someone once said, <strong>“Patience is a tree whose roots are bitter, but its fruits are sweet.” </strong>It is also said that, <strong>“Patience it the Queen of virtues.” </strong>When this queen is joined together with,<strong> “Faith”, king of virtues</strong>, there is no obstacle or problem or difficulty or circumstance that can stand on their way. Everything bows before them, and departs with great regrets, sorrow and disappointment. They turn <strong>disappointment into appointment</strong> with God for achievement of your dreams and arrival at your destiny. In order to develop these virtues, you must get accustomed to doing three things consistently:<strong> 1.) You must trust God, 2.) You must communicate (prayer) with God, 1.) You must listen to God, mostly, through His word-the Bible. </strong>\r\n\r\nIn our today’s text, Joshua, who was leading the Israelites to their conquest faced an impossible obstacle- Jericho City. They could not move ahead without passing through Jericho. The wall of Jericho was very high and firm. The foundation of the wall was carefully and strongly laid, reinforced such that the children of Israel could not, whatsoever, enter to attack and destroy and loot the good stuff that was locked in there. Can you imagine the frustration of Joshua and the Israelites?\r\n\r\nIf you have faced some things that just blocked you so that no matter what you did or didn’t do, you couldn’t move on or make progress or have breakthrough, then you may empathize with these children of God. Remember, I didn’t say “sympathize.” (Personally I don’t like that word that much. Sympathy is one of those commodities I don’t consume that much and I don’t enjoy very much the company of people who offer me sympathy for whatever reason). Anyway, that is beside the point.\r\n\r\nAnyway, how did Joshua and his people overcome the wall of Jericho? The Bible says that God gave them a strategy. He told them to gather together and quietly go round the city seven times for seven days. And on the seventh day, they would shout with a big shout, blowing their trumpets. And when they did that, the scripture says “ …<strong>, the people shouted…and it came to pass, when the people heard, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell flat, so that the people went up into the city…and the took the city.” (vs.20). </strong>Amen!\r\n\r\nWhat a simple, stupid, senseless, childish and irrational strategy God gave Joshua. How could he and his troop, as intelligent and sensible as all of them were, believe what God said? Well, they didn’t care whether it made sense or not, they just acted it and got the result. Sometimes God will say things to you that don’t make sense. <strong>Victory from God is won by faith not by understanding or working hard or by use of powerful things or even people</strong>. <strong>The just shall live by faith…not by works</strong>. Today many of you are probably facing obstacles that you have tried to overcome for a long time but you have not been able. Listen to God and start going round the obstacle. You may have to do that continuously for a long time. May be seven hours, or seven days, or weeks or months or even years. Don’t give up. Each time you go round it, you are weakening the walls of your obstacles. They will soon fall down, never again to be seen. Have a blessed going around your wall day!!! Blessings Bro Boaz"

              "<strong>1John 5:4, \"He that is born of God overcomes the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith\".</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Overcoming an obstacle by climbing on top of its roof and tearing it down courageously by faith, and with great determination, pushing on until you reach Jesus for your miracle</strong>, is the subject of today’s devotion.\r\n\r\nI hope and pray that we can learn some more on things that will help grow our faith so we can be more prepared to overcome many of life’s hindrances we face every day.<!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more--><!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn yesterday’s message, I emphasized two virtues that are necessary for overcoming an obstacle that may require going round it for a long time. These virtues are Faith and Patience.<strong> Today, I would like to emphasize again the virtue of faith, in addition to determination, and courage, as necessary tools for tearing down the roof tops of any obstacle that may stand in the way, between you and Jesus, hindering you from receiving your desired miracle. </strong>\r\n\r\nHave you ever been excited about something you had been promised and were expecting? I mean something you really would love to have or see and then all over sudden, something happens and you couldn’t have it or see it?. That usually triggers disappointment that can degenerate into discouragement and serious depression. Is there anything that can be done before getting that far? That depends on what choices and decisions you make. You can let obstacles get over your roof and tear you down or you can chose to climb over the rooftops of your obstacles, tear them down, and zoom right into the presence of Christ for your miracle. <strong>“… I have set before you this day life and death, blessings and cursing, chose life…”(Deut.30-30).</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are four people the Bible talks about in the Gospel of Mark 2, who could not allow anything to stop them from reaching Jesus so they could fulfill a promise they had given to a paralytic man they had picked from the street where he was begging. These four men had faith in Jesus. They believed that Jesus could heal the paralytic and set him free so he could move on with a normal and productive happy life. They told the paralytic about Jesus and the man liked the idea. So, they trekked down the dusty road, and finally reached the house where Jesus was teaching and preaching the kingdom of God. When they arrived, the house was full to capacity and the crowd could not allow them to pass through to Jesus. What did they do? <strong>They made a faith decision, no obstacle was going to stop them from seeing Jesus. They climbed the rooftop, tore the roof, tied the paralytic man’s bed with a rope and lowered him as fast as they could right in front of Jesus.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>When Jesus saw their faith, he said, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.” </strong>Note what he saw-<strong>their faith</strong>. That made him stop what He was doing to give the men who had faith what they badly needed-the restoration of the paralytic’s health and extension of his life. He saw and honored their faith. He didn’t even bother to ask them who they were and where they had come from or why they had committed a property damage crime. He didn’t yell at them for disturbing his meeting and changing His program. He gave them what they came for and claimed by faith and by all means.\r\n\r\nThe decisions taken by the four men and the paralytic exhibits faith, courage and determination, without which they could not have gone passed the crowed to Jesus. If we also want to see Jesus, and bring all our cares to Him, we must make up our mind that we will climb over the rooftops of anything, including: doubts, fear, ignorance, pride, confusion, disappointment, poverty or wealth, laziness, lies, un-forgiveness, bitterness, racism, religion, traditions, etc. And tear them down and lower ourselves in God’s presence. Then, we will receive whatever we have need of according to His will. The Bible says that if we humble ourselves under the mighty hands of God, He will lift us up in due season. That won’t happen if we are not decided, determined, and courageous enough to take drastic steps of faith for overcoming any obstacle we may face in life. Blessings Boaz"

              "<strong>Luke 2:22, “Then because of Divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by a different route”. (Modern Language), </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Luke 2:22, “And being warned of God, in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. King James</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Today’s word, Change course, if necessary. </strong>Everyone dreams of becoming something, or having success or loving someone and or marrying that someone or going somewhere or achieving some goals etc. These are some of the dreams and desires which, when fulfilled, add excitement, joy and happiness in our lives. God, our Heavenly Father wants us to joyous, successful and happy. However, most of the time, we don’t actualize these. We often face unpredictable challenges, traps and even danger that in some cases kill our dreams and us.<!--more--><!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>We have an enemy whose mission is to steal, kill and destroy (John 10:10). </strong>He does not care who we are or where we are. He will make every attempt to kill us. He schemes plans every day to track us down to either stop us from being what God meant for us to be or kill us. But, the good news is, <strong>“we are safe with God, even in the valley of the shadow of death…we shall fear no evil because God is with us.” (Psalms 23) He also will guide our way</strong>. At times, He will change our plans or routes that we intended to take. For instance, He may let you go to a career you never wanted or marry someone you never thought you could marry or lead you to a town or city you never wanted to live in. He may at times instruct you to move from somewhere or out of a relationship with someone you feel you love for or care about. But whatever He does or instruct you to do, His intention is always good. <strong>He will only change your plans that may not fit in with His will for you</strong>. <strong>He will also change routes if He sees danger a head on the way you are going</strong>. He will instruct or warn you not to do something or head another way. It is important, therefore, for us the children of God to be flexible and willing to change route or our plans when God tells us to. How then can we know His will? Well His will is His word. Listen to the word. Listen to good counsel. Listen to yourself and, align what you are listening to the word. If you obey, you may save yourself from future pain, failure or hardship or death. Don’t insist on your ways always. Don’t have the mentality most people have “<strong> my way or no way.” </strong>Don’t compromise to please people or pride yourself to death. And don’t think that you are very “mature” and “strong” and that you can make it alone. None of us is, we all need God’s leading because he, alone, knows the way that we take.\r\n\r\nJob said <strong>“ He knows the way that I take, after He has tried me, I shall come forth like gold” (Job 23:10). </strong>Do you believe that God knows the way or road or path that you need to follow into your future dreams? Do you believe that God has a good plan for you to give you your expectation (Jeremiah 29:11)? If you believe God and all His promises, then let go of yourself and let God change your plans and lead you to any path He may choose whether you understand it or not. Heed to his warnings and you shall live and stay out of a lot of troubles and traps of Satan.\r\nIf you don’t, you may miss or lose something. For example:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Samson lost his divine power, eyes and finally died tragically, because he didn’t heed God’s and his parent's warning and advise not to love and marry Philistine women;</li>\r\n\t<li>Saul lost his kingship career, was rejected by God and died in battle, a tragic death</li>\r\n\t<li>Many children of Israelites died in the wilderness because they ignored God’s instruction, and his servant Moses’ leadership:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIf you heed God’s warnings, and follow, His instructions, be willing to change route yourself or let Him do so at will, you will avoid a lot of, if not all, obstacles in life including premature death or evil Satan may bring your way and mine. For example:\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n\t<li>The Wise men, who announced the good news of Jesus’ birth, went back to their country through a different route. God warned them not to go to Herod. They escaped death!</li>\r\n\t<li>Joseph and his young wife and infant (baby Jesus) escaped to Egypt, through a different route, and had their baby escape infanticide by the hand of Herod. <strong>“…Rise, take your child and his mother and escape to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you …And he arose and took the child and his mother by night. And departed to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod.” (Mathew 2:13-15)</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIs there anything, issue or problem that is or has really been an obstacle in your life? Review carefully, honestly and prayerfully on your beliefs, attitudes, motivations, associations, plans, dreams and desires etc., and if you are convinced and convicted that you need to change route, then do it. And do it today.<strong> You shall live and have good success (Josh: 1:8), blessings Boaz</strong>"

              "<b>James 3:1-18, \"But no man can tame the tongue...\"</b>\r\n\r\nThe tongue has landed so many people into trouble. As much as what people do destroy, what people say can do even a greater damage and it's because what has been done may quickly heal unlike what has been said stays in the memory. Friendships have been broken due to what came out of the tongue. Husbands and wives have ended up in great fights because of the tongue. <!--more-->\r\n\r\n<b>Proverbs 18:22, says \"Death and life is in the power of the tongue...\", </b>as you can see, the tongue is a very small instrument in our bodies but has power. James gives us an example of how powerful the tongue is vs. 4 where he says, <b>\"...ships: although they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires\" </b>and so is the tongue, it has power to control the entire body. The tongue can start fire and spread it like wild fire fast. The fire is never satisfied when it is consuming and so is the tongue. In school as a teenager, my mouth always landed me in trouble. I never had strength to physically fight so I fought with my tongue. I always got beaten because of my mouth. <b>James </b>again says in <b>vs. 6, \"And the tongue is a fire of world of iniquity. The tongue is so set among our members that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature\"</b>. It's by the tongue that cussing and swearing comes about; backbiting and gossip; all lies are spread by the tongue; deception and misleading mostly come through the tongue; persuasion and manipulations are other results of what the tongue can do. There is so much that the tongue can do and yet <b>James 3:8, says \"But no man can tame the tongue\". </b>We use the tongue to scold, to nag, to slander, to quarrel. No man can tame the tongue. Under pressure and anger, people have said things that should have not come out of their mouths at all. What was released by the tongue damaged big time in small amount of time.\r\n\r\nThe bible does not say that the tongue cannot be tamed, it only tells us man cannot tame it. This instrument of speech can be used <b>DESTRUCTIVELY</b> or employed <b>CONSTRUCTIVELY</b>. <b>James 3:9, \"With it (tongue) we bless our God, and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God\" vs. 10 \"Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing\". </b>\r\n\r\nI am not just talking about what you say that affect others but what you also say that affects you. Many speak,  defeat, curses in their lives. Instead of being an encouragement to themselves like David for the sake of God’s destiny, hope and courage for them, they use it as knife to cut their own throats. No wonder many fall in depression and sickness for they have taken their tongue and used it as a lethal weapon to bring destruction to themselves. You can tell the outworking of the internal by what someone has inside. <b>Luke 6:45, says \"...of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks</b>\" and with this verse you can tell what someone has inside as that is what will come out. <b>The tongue is the manifestation of what is inside, it brings out what is harbored inside.</b> As said earlier, man cannot tame the tongue but God can for what gets out of men's control does not get out of God's control. My tongue and your tongue ought to be used to build and not tear; bless and not curse; promote and not demote; uplift and not bring down. It's in the process of yielding to the Lordship of Jesus Christ that we learn the art of using our tongue to glorify God.\r\n\r\nYou will never bring your tongue under God's control until you realize you need it controlled. <b>Isaiah 6:5, \"So I said, woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips (tongue), And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts\"</b>. Isaiah could not see the damage his tongue was doing until his eyes saw the Lord of hosts and how Holy He is and then realized who he was. <b>Isaiah 6:7, \"And he touched my mouth with it (live coal), and said: \"Behold, this has touched your lips; Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is purged\". </b>With his admission and confession, he humbled himself and the Lord touched his lips (tongue) with a live coal. Live coal will burn however it will do you and I good. Isaiah was not ready for service until a transformation took place in his life. Where are you with your tongue? what damages has your tongue done? have you asked for forgiveness from those that you hurt with your words? are you gossiping behind someone's back? \"<b>Remember that he/she who tells you about others, also tells others about you</b>\". In short, is your tongue under God's control, <b>BRING IT UNDER HIS CONTROL. Blessings Ev</b>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://manofhonourproject.wordpress.com/2013/05/02/tongue-taming/\" target=\"_blank\">Tongue Taming.</a> (manofhonourproject.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Romans 5:1-20, \"3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn order to function effectively as Christians, we constantly need to remind ourselves that we are nomadic people here on earth. God is working on us climbing us from glory to glory.\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 5:1</strong> says \"<strong>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God</strong>\", this verse opens the door for us to be saved, the beginning of growth as we move (grow). This is justification which God does for us and none of us have a part in our justification by faith. It’s like we’ve passed an exam we did not sit for and could not pass it on our own regardless of how prepared we were. Because we are justified, we have peace with God meaning the war God had with us through our wicked mind has been settled by Christ on the cross.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 2, “Through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God”</strong>. Grace is what we don’t deserve, it is God’s unmerited favor. When you understand that you are favored, you rejoice, but this is not the end but the beginning and so your faith is elevated because you know who is holding your life.\r\n\r\nThese two verses about sanctification is where we struggle to embrace<strong>, Vs. 3&amp;4, “3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope</strong>.“ If we rejoice and glory in favor, we need to remember that we can also rejoice and glory in tribulation. I know not of a great tool to grow one than the school master of tribulations. It’s through it that people pray more, it’s an agent of purification, if channeled properly it helps you see God in ways you could never imagine or think. David in <strong>Psalm 119:71 </strong>tells us how beneficial tribulations were to him<strong>, “It is good for me that I have been afflicted, That I may learn Your statutes”. </strong>Affliction, tribulation of any kind acts as a wholesome discipline in leading the pious more highly to value the truth and promises of God.\r\n\r\nWhen we glory in tribulation, we understand that tribulations are just for a season and joy is eternal. <strong>Tribulation</strong> <strong>(hardships) </strong>tailors one into <strong>patience (perseverance),</strong> as patience is not something that is taught in a classroom setting, it is learnt and mastered in the sea of life. <strong>Patience </strong>builds <strong>experience (character)</strong>. Having gone through hardships and patience, you become wise and experienced in giving advice, counsel, make wise decisions in regards to where you get your help. <strong>Character </strong>produces <strong>Hope</strong> and hope does not a shame. It’s in tribulation that a saint should hold on to Christ tight and hope for the life to come. God knows how to take us through the process of life that He may make us be like Jesus, people of character, people who can be at peace in tough times in the midst of a chaotic world. All this work is to make us bear fruit, more fruit and much fruit. The gardener has to prune, dig around the tree, remove the weeds that hinder that tree from bearing fruits. And if the tree is bearing fruit's, He still works on it to bear more and much. There are certain tough things the Lord has allowed in our lives to teach us patience in our work places, friends. As we go through them, our character is being enlarged. We learn to love the unlovely, we learn to forgive and even pray for those who despitefully use us, we learn to put ourselves in someone else shoes to feel their pain.\r\n\r\nI thank God that <strong>He moves me </strong>from stage to stage with His hands upon my life. Even in the midst of tribulations, I know that it’s working for His purpose and I’m learning things I could not learn in any other way, bearing fruit, more fruit and much fruit. The more He moves me, <strong>the more he grows me in Him.

              "<strong>Genesis 3:21, “21 And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them,” (TRSV).</strong>\r\n\r\nAdam and Eve disobeyed God, Eve was deceived and Adam listened to his wife and disobeyed God. Immediately they went into hiding because they were naked and a shamed of what they did. They tried to cover themselves with leaves, which did not do a good job as they were bound to dry and fall off.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nInstead of taking responsibility for what they had done, they began to find excuses to blame for their fall. Adam blamed his wife, his wife blamed the serpent. Is this not true with us today, always finding it easy to blame something or someone for our mistakes?<i> \"She betrayed me, he tricked me, he made me do it etc.\".</i> People even blame God today for their mistakes saying <i>“it’s God’s fault, He made me like this”</i>. Shifting blames began in the first marriage and it's still affecting us even today.\r\n\r\nOut of what they had done, there came consequences but in the midst of it all, God was merciful to clothe them. The first animals shade their blood for these two when God slew them. The Lord furnished the skins, fashioned the garments, and clothed Adam and Eve. God did it all; they did nothing. After divine condemnation and judgment for this first sin, God acted in mercy to provide a way of salvation, and He demonstrated His grace to cover the shame of man.\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 4:7, \"Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, And whose sins are covered;\"</strong> This does not mean God over looks our sins and neither did he overlook Adam and Eve's sin by covering it up, this is God taking that which is naked and shameful and clothes it with Christ's Righteousness. The first physical death should have been that of this man and his wife, but it was an animal—a shadow of the reality that God would someday kill a substitute to redeem sinners. Didn't the Lord clothe us in our sin that rendered us naked and ashamed? What a kind God He is.\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 13:14, \"But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts\".</strong> Putting on the Lord Jesus not only covers our sins but it also protects us from exposing ourselves to sin and the desire to fulfill it. To put on the Lord Jesus also is to put on humility. We try to find ways to be worthy by trying to cover ourselves with leaves of self-righteousness however those leaves need to come down so that the God of grace and mercy can provide us with garments. The prodigal son in <strong>Luke 15</strong> having lost and found his way back home received a different treatment from what he had expected. The bible says,<strong>Vs. 20-22, “20 And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 21 And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ 22 “But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the BEST ROBE (GARMENT) and PUT IT ON HIM, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</strong> He uncovered himself by taking off the leaves by admitting his sin, and his father demonstrated his love and compassion by putting on him the best robe. Notice that the prodigal son did not blame his age, the country he went to, what he got involved in, or what had happened to him. He took responsibility for what he had done and cried for mercy.<strong>Proverbs 28:13</strong>\r\n\r\n<b>\"He who covers his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.\"</b> We praise God for clothing us in spite of it all, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 21:16, “…Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants, You have perfected praise</strong>”\r\n\r\nI have come to believe that to know someone really well, see how they deal with pressure. I try to void being stressed out for it is not healthy. I refuse cuss or swear when things come my way because cussing and swearing don’t help anyway, it’s not a mark of a Christian and out of cussing mouth can no sweet praises come.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe need to understand that we are responsible for our actions and therefore we need to be very careful how we deal with overwhelming situations and circumstances. One of the greatest tools to help overcome tough times is praise.  Praise is not a matter of how we feel but a choice we make. The bible tells us from the verse above that “<strong>out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants, You have perfected praise”</strong>.  This is not for some people of a certain class but for everyone. The moment you make this choice, the Lord will perfect it for Himself.<strong>Psalms 150:6, “Let everything that has breath praise the Lord”.\r\n</strong>\r\n<strong>Isaiah 61:3, “…To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for the mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they maybe called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified”</strong>. There is a time to mourn, be down, even get discouraged, but you can never be in the same place forever, you have to rise up, the Lord is changing you to fit in the atmosphere and giving you what you do not have to so as to praise Him. Number one, He is giving us beauty for ashes. Other translations says a crown of beauty instead of ashes. Number two, He gives us oil of joy for the mourning. No joy, no praise, and there is a difference between being happy and being joyful. Being happy goes with the mood, being joyful goes with what is given and choosing to make it work regardless of what you have to face. The bible says that the <strong>joy of the Lord is my strength</strong>, His joy gives you strength to endure. Number three, He gives us the garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness. In my judgement this is the main thing, though it is made, you and I have to pick it up and put it on after taking off garments of heaviness. Garments of heaviness in this case could be stress, frustrations, pressure, overwhelmed by what you have to deal with. You have a choice to remove the garments of heaviness and put on the garments of praise. \"<em>Thank You for grace to endure, I praise You for the best You have deposited in me can now come out under all these pressure. This enables me to be calm in the midst of my storm. Many see me deal with things differently and it’s not because I have everything together but because You have given me a new garment</em>” This ought to be our attitude, for the same God who has allowed a lot to come our way is the same God who will give us enough grace and strength to make it. The only way we will make it is by adjusting our attitudes and taking what He has set aside to help us make it through the day, the garments of praise.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>2chronicles 20</strong> King Jehoshaphat was faced by a great army, he proclaimed a fast throughout the land and all people cried to God. In vs. 15, a word comes to them saying they didn’t need to fight in this battle for the battle was the Lord’s. Therefore they thought to themselves, if the Lord is going to fight for us, we can do something else, we can praise Him. The moment they began to praise the Lord, The Lord  was moved by their praises that He set an ambush on the enemy. The king and his people did not see God fight but they saw the results. You praise Him and you will not see Him fight, you will only see results. Walls of Jericho came down under the power of praises and shouts. Put on the garments of praise today and let the praise go before you as you start the day. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Genesis 3:1-21, \"The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThe book of Genesis is known as the book of the beginnings, it's the book that reveals creation and the purpose of God for humanity. It presents us with the picture of God being a skillful Creator who does things in skillful ways. If that is not enough, we see things working and moving systematically in the order of creation. Everything God created was done step by step and each step He looked back and concluded it was good. I'm amazed at His creativity, the thinking and planning in the sense that He did not create man on the first day otherwise where would He put him? Many other things begin to make sense when you look at the structure in which He took to make things come out. To continue my amazement at His work, He called things into existence and everything He spoke into existence had no choice but to obey the voice of the Creator, the bible says in <strong>Isaiah 55:11, \"So shall My Word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it\". <!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nWhen He speaks, living and none living things hears and act according to His voice. When it came to making man, He reached to the ground and formed man. He did not speak man into existence, He created and formed man into existence and ever since, the Lord is concerned about man because He created human being with a desire that He will live and fellowship with Him. Man had no need to be a shamed of anything for He was covered by the glory of God. Adam and Eve were not led by their own wisdom and knowledge, they were led by the auspicious presence of God, always showering them day and night. Man was complete, perfect, in place until he made a choice. In as much as God created man and showered him with everything, He gave him a will to make choices, but not before He told them of what would happen if they made certain choices. If the Lord did not tell them of the outcomes, we would say they did not know and shouldn't be blamed but there was explanation for every choice. <strong>The bible says that behold I have set blessings and curses before you, choose. Choose ye this day whom you will serve either be God or mammon.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe fall of man stripped him of the covering he had and all of a sudden, man began living in shame, feeling naked running away from the Lord. He started shifting blames and since then, it’s hard for man to be healed while living in deception. Listen to this, <strong>1John 1:8 says, \"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us\", 1John 1:10, \"If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His words is not in us\". </strong>It’s hard for man to take responsibility for his actions and therefore healing becomes hard. One thing I believe is that we will not be healed if we are living in lies, we cannot force wrong things to be right, we cannot justify what is not accepted. If the Lord hated it then, He still hates it today and there is no shortcut or any way around it, the only way is, repent and be ye saved.\r\n\r\nPraise to His name, He has so many ways to raise us up when we fail, but we have to be willing to admit that we have failed. No one can lead someone who feels that they know the way, You and I do not know the way for if we know Him not, we know not the way. <strong>John 14:6, \"...I Am the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh to the Father, but by Me\". </strong>Mark the way it puts it, I Am “<strong>THE”</strong> way not I Am “<strong>A” </strong>way. If He said “I Am” “A” way, it would have messed everything up for that implies that He is one of the ways and so there must be other ways. He distinguished and made Himself the command factor by saying He is “The way” meaning the only way and He is THE truth and THE life. Choose you this day by whose way you will go.

              "<strong>Genesis 3:1-21, \"The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them\"</strong>\r\n\r\nA garment is a type of coat or robe especially used for official purposes. In Genesis after the fall of man, Adam and Eve having had knowledge of their nakedness moved to cover themselves by making for themselves clothing out of leaves. When men fell, 1. Immediately they knew they had failed God, 2. They discovered they were naked and 3. They developed a need to hide. We understand that there are things as human beings we can do on our own and might work but the truth is, it will not last for long. They had leaves covering them not realizing that leaves would soon dry up and fall off. So man tries so hard to cover his nakedness only for it to work but for a season. The bible tells me that there are things that if God does not do, anything someone else will do will be in vain.<strong> Psalm 127:1, \"Except the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain that build it: Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh in vain\". </strong>I would say that this verse means that anything you are going to do if the Lord is not involved in it, however hard you try and do it, it will never work.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Genesis 3:21, \"The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them\". </strong>Here comes the Lord who knows that whatever man will do, will not work unless He steps in. He made garments of skin for Adam and his wife. I paused here for a sec, the Lord did not tell them what to do and how to do it, He stepped in and did it for them. We see the first death of an animal, the first sacrifice. Even in the midst of their failure, God still knew how vulnerable man was without Him therefore He reached the poor material “man” and did something for him. Remember the scripture we just looked at, “<strong>Except or unless the Lord does it, man will be doing it in vain”</strong>. Whatever the Lord does comes already blessed, He can only bless what His hands are on.\r\n\r\nI also wondered why garments and nothing else, let's look at why the Lord loves garments, In <strong>Exodus 28:1-5</strong>, God is giving instructions to Moses on what to do for the priests He had appointed (Aaron and his sons). <strong>Exodus 28:2-3, \"2 Make sacred garments for your brother Aaron, to give him dignity and honor, vs. 3, \"Tell all the skilled men to whom I have given wisdom in such matters that they are to make garments for Aaron, for his consecration, so he may serve me as a priest\".</strong> Can you see that the garments were to give him dignity and honor and then for his consecration. In the olden times, the priests ministered to the Lord and brought messages from the Lord to the people. There were people who were given special tasks to do this kind of service. When Jesus died on the cross, the ones who received Him, <strong>He gave them power to become, </strong>and now we are priests who minister to the Lord daily. Only God could clothe us again with dignity and honor by sending His Son to the cross to die for the shamed human race and Paul writes in <strong>Romans 13:14, \"Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ … \", </strong>putting on the Lord Jesus gives us dignity and honor and we get consecrated which is to say being set apart for the Master. God had to clothe us with Jesus to remove all our guilt and shame.<strong> NOT ONLY DID HE PROVIDE THE GARMENTS, HE ALSO CLOTHED THEM.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe garments were not made of cheap imitated materials, let’s go back to <strong>Exodus 28:4-5, \"4 These are garments they are to make: a breast piece, an ephod, a robe, a woven tunic, a turban and a sash. 5, \"have them use gold, and blue, and purple and scarlet yarn, and the fine linen\". </strong>We said God is skillful in making things, everything is done systematically and goes through different stages. <strong>Because this was a special project ordained by Him, the skilled men could not make the garments outside His instructions (Except the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain), </strong>it was as if <strong>God is giving them the architectural plan executed in heaven in readiness for the building down here</strong>. The plan, the structure, what kind of materials to be used were budgeted for in heaven by God. He gave the final architectural plan as a sign that He has built it already. Yes it may still look like it's ink and paper but it's a done job. <strong>He calls those things which are not as though they are.</strong> Our garments are skillfully designed in heaven and God is executing that plan here on earth through His Son by the power of the Holy Spirit. Garments reserved for us are not made of cheap materials and they are not just made, they are skillfully designed by the Creator of all. It's a blessing to know that my garments is <strong>CUSTOM MADE </strong>and has the label “JESUS”, He is the reason for the garment. Let's look at different garments in the next session.

              "<strong>Genesis 3:1-21, \"The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe looked at God the Creator stepping in making Adam and Eve garments and not only making them garments, but He also clothed them. We also saw how the plans of God are executed in heaven to be performed and perfected here on earth. We pray “<strong>let Your will be done here on earth as it is done in heaven”, </strong>in other words, let you Your architectural plan for our lives be performed and perfected here on earth.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhen the prodigal son went to a far country and squandered everything, he came back home as a slave however his father had a different plan for his son<strong> Luke 15:21-22, “21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. 22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him;…”. </strong>The one that deserved to be punished received the best robe (garment), a chance to become what he blew. His father's love, his attitude of humility and repentance opened a door for restoration. In <strong>Isaiah 61:3, \"And provide for those who grieve in Zion-to bestow on them a crown of beauty, instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and garment of praise instead of spirit of despair\" (NIV). </strong>Amen, the Lord already has a covering for those who are mourning, He structured it in heaven and He is commanding His chosen ones to execute them here on earth by telling them to provide unto the grieving in Zion a crown of beauty, oil of gladness and the garments of praise. Many are struggling to worship because they are wearing garments of heaviness leading to depression, confusion, broken, have no joy but the Lord would have His word come to you who is struggling today, <i>\"I have a garment of praise for the spirit of despair to give to you, I will take what you have and replace it with what I have, garments of praise\". </i>\r\n\r\nJoseph in the book of Genesis had a father who loved him so much so he made him something special, <strong>Genesis 37:3, \"Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age. Also he made him a tunic (coat, robe) of many colors</strong>\". Jacob had a reason for making his son a coat of many colors. I see it this way, though Joseph had a coat of many colors, he did not know that was symbolic for when he was sold into Egypt and later became the number 2 man, he was able to serve everyone without discrimination, he was able to serve all races, colors, all personalities, all genders in other words, he served everyone equally. We’ve received Jesus, the coat of many colors, we can now serve anyone and everyone for what we were not we are now because we’ve been made.\r\n\r\nTime fails me for there so much about the garments we could learn from, example, Jesus wore garments while here on earth and we see a woman with the issue of blood touching the hem of His garments in <strong>Matthew 9:20</strong>. At His crucifixion, the soldiers parted His garments among them. There is something about the garments and we are blessed to have God prepare and clothe us with them.\r\n\r\nI’m glad He has me covered,. My needs, desires dreams, ambitions and goals are covered. When you think that nothing is happening, just remember that He has you covered. You may not feel it, it is not a matter of feeling, it's a matter of knowing and believing that He has His garments on you. Prayer covers us; and just like the paint covers the surface when applied, the blood of Jesus has covered us. <strong>\"The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them\", NOT ONLY DOES HE MAKE THE GARMENTS FOR US, HE HAS US COVERED WITH THEM.

              "<strong>Philippians 4:6&amp;7, \"... and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your heart and minds through Christ Jesus\"</strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the things that has taught me how the Lord grants us peace is while being driven by someone who I know. Of all my brothers, only Kefa I trust his driving. When he is driving, I can doze off and relax. Because I know his ways, <strong>that knowledge gives me peace in side to ride with him</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe world craves for peace. You can give love but I don't think you can give peace, you can speak it. This is one of the greatest tools people need in their life. Many suicides take place because the victims most of the time have no peace within. Peace in the home, at work, in marriage. But what is peace? <strong>Peace is to be calm, quiet, still, silence, harmony</strong>. In other words, peace is the absence of war. Without peace, chaos, frustrations and confusion erupt and the devil is the enemy against peace. If he can steal away your peace, he knows he would have stripped you of something very important and powerful.\r\n\r\nTrue peace originates from God. Let's look at three aspects of Peace. <strong>PEACE WITH GOD, PEACE IN GOD, and PEACE OF GOD</strong>. <strong>Romans 5:1, \"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have PEACE WITH GOD through our Lord Jesus Christ</strong>\". This is experienced when we receive Christ. We are no longer children under His wrath, we have made peace with God in that regards. When I am not in Christ, I am an enemy of God and the only way to settle it is repentance and faith.\r\n\r\n<strong>Romans 15:13, \"Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and PEACE IN BELIEVING, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost\". </strong>This is peace in God knowing that I have hope and joy for I have escaped the wrath to come, having passed from death to life. This is also peace knowing that I am no longer alone, He lives in me. My peace comes from knowing that one day when this life is over, I will be with Him in heaven and not spend eternity in hell.\r\n\r\nThe message today dwells on <strong>PEACE OF GOD</strong>, <strong>Philippians 4:7, \"... and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your heart and minds through Christ Jesus\". </strong>This is the kind of peace we need every day to sustain us through life. I don't see how one can truly have the peace of God without first having “peace with God” and “peace in God”. The peace of God is what we need when we have overwhelming and out of control situations. The Lord taking over as the driver and you sleep through His driving is “peace of God”. Your knowledge of who He is and what He is cable of gives you peace inside. <strong>Psalm 34:8, \"O, taste and see that the Lord is good, blessed is the man who trusts in Him</strong>\". <strong>Peace comes through trusting</strong>. This is not even your peace but the peace of God. The funny thing is that you can sense it but not explain it because it surpasses all understanding.\r\n\r\nHow do I get this peace, <strong>Philippians 4:6, \"Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make your request be known to God</strong>\", stop worrying and trying to dictate God and believe that He's has it covered. Surrender everything to Him through prayers and take the back seat. Don't forget to thank Him for what He is doing and what He will do, then go to sleep, rest, relax, be calm, <strong>Psalms 46:10, \"Be still (be at peace) and know He is God\". </strong>How do I maintain this peace, <strong>Isaiah 26:3, \"You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You</strong>\". This is meditation on God’s truth about Himself. Paul continues to write in <strong>Philippians 4:8, \"whatsoever things are true...noble...just...pure...lovely...good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy, meditate on this things</strong>\". You keep the peace by meditating on the things of God. If you have no “peace with God” and “peace in God” ask yourself, where are you heading to? If you lack “peace of God” in what you are going through, ask of Him and when it comes, by all means maintain it. The peace of God will sustain you through everything, some situations may not change immediately but having peace to go through it will bring you joy. Peace of God will pull you together while chaos from the devil will tear you into pieces. Without the peace of God, you will be torn into pieces. Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>Psalm 37:4, \"Delight yourself also in the LORD, And He shall give you the desires of your heart\" </strong>\r\n\r\nI received an email some time back with this question, \"How to find God's will for your life\". This is one of those topics I have no direct answer to. Walking with the Lord has led me to know what His will is for my life. I still don't know what His will is in certain areas but I can see the direction He is leading me to. I have shared from this topic before but for the sake of the new people and those who are struggling, may this word ignite something in your spirit.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI believe that for someone to know the will of God they must first know God, I don't mean know \"about God\" but actually \"know God\". When you see things that He responds to, what brings glory to His name, things He disapproves etc. then you know what to do. All these are revealed in His word. His word becomes the manual book<strong>. Romans 10:17, \"Faith comes by hearing and by hearing the word of God</strong>\". This is the beginning to understanding the will of God (Seek ye first) before knowing the will of God for your life (and all these other things shall be added unto you). His word teaches us what God is like so us to respond according to His word. When you know God, you begin to learn your position in His kingdom; you begin to look for opportunities to operate in your position. Knowing God brings a massive change as in all about yourself is sifted and He fills you with more of Him and less of you.\r\n\r\n<strong>Proverbs 10:32, \"The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable</strong>”. This vs. talks about the \"righteous\", those who Christ lives in their lives. Those who have been made new creatures know what pleases Christ because of what they have learnt from Him. These are the ones with new appetites stirred up by Christ living inside. Anything that comes at this time is no longer for selfish desires but seeking opportunities to make Him shine.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 37:4 \"Delight yourself also in the LORD…\". </strong>The word <strong>\"DELIGHT\"</strong> means to take great pleasure. This as an opportunity to please the Lord with my life style because of what I have learnt from Him. In the book of Genesis, Cain and Abel brought sacrifices before God. Cain brought what he had done by himself and God did not receive it, Abel on the other hand brought that which the Lord required, a blood sacrifice. He was bringing to God what would please Him and he was offering it to God by faith. Remember again, \"<strong>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God</strong>\". Abel was delighting himself in the Lord, God had showed them what pleased Him. How did I know what God required? I learnt it from His word and I began to seek opportunities to glorify Him in all that I was doing. How did I know His will? Through promptings also confirmed by other people, through gifts given I never had, by thought He dropped in my mind in light of His word. What do all these have in common? They are to bring GLORY TO HIS NAME. This has been my way of delighting in the Lord. God is faithful because when you recognize that it's not about you, He raises you to greater levels, gives you blessings you were never qualified for simply because you delight in Him.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"…And He shall give you the desires of your heart</strong>\", this scripture can be misapplied. Anyone can have ugly, selfish or wrong desires of their heart but here is the key, when you delight yourself in the Lord, He will show you things He has stored for you in His vault. You begin to have an appetite for them, those becomes the desires of your heart and God gives them to you as His will for your life. There are many who will never progress because they are waiting to hear God speak audibly. At times God will open a door and you will need to walk through it. At times He will give you a thought and expect you to begin to develop on that thought as He works with you, it all begins with delighting in the Lord. I have learnt that the more I sought opportunities to glorify Him in what I do, the more He blessed me. That is how I have progressed to be a prayer warrior, a teacher of the word, a minister through devotions, a preacher, witnessing on the streets, encouraging others and even counseling etc., I know because I know Him and more are to come, it's all about glorifying Him .

              "<strong>Mark 5:25-34, \"...For she said, if I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nDesperate people do desperate things if they know that whatever they've have to do will make an impact and a difference in their lives. When you know your restoration depends on something extraordinary, bigger than you, you will not care about what people say or think. A woman with the issue of blood was in a situation where she spent everything trying to fix her condition. For 12years she had spent money, visited worthless physicians with no improvement only to be left hopeless.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHer condition had robbed her of freedom, relationships, comfort, joy, peace and even money, nevertheless she was determined to get well. At times you just need assurance that there is still hope in the midst of hopelessness and knowing that whatever is impossible with man is possible with God. She heard about many miracles Jesus had performed (Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God (Jesus) and she perceived in herself that her health will only come back through Jesus Christ. Ashamed of herself and her condition, she encouraged herself, <strong>\"... if I may touch but His clothes, I shall be whole...\". </strong>Her faith is so much boosted to the extent that she knows that if just His name is a strong tower, then even power would flow through what He is wearing. I see her telling herself how she didn’t even have to talk to Him or get noticed after all no one wanted her around or be around her anyway.\r\n\r\nIn my life I have seen areas that I really needed to touch the hem of His garment because I knew what I was going through not everyone would understand my situation. A desperation propelled me to find Jesus and touch His garment. You will not always have someone help you find Him but yourself, and you have to be strong enough to encourage yourself.<strong> “It shall be well” ought to be your attitude</strong>. <strong>She encouraged herself in the midst of hell and her encouragement helped her make the first move</strong>. Crawling under people trying to find her way to Jesus was a move she made. We don't hear her telling people how she is too sick and needs special help to reach the Master, she decided to move looking unto Jesus. When there is no one to carry you to the Master, calm and encourage yourself, crawl if need be, push the obstacles aside and make it to the Master.\r\n\r\nSomething amazing, everyone who had been walking with Jesus some at distance and some very close to Him. With that in mind, at least people touched Him whether they wanted to or not and Jesus never questioned them, but when this woman touched Him, He felt power leave Him and He stopped, looked around and asked, <strong>\"WHO TOUCHED ME?\"</strong>. Isn't it funny that many people can walk around the Lord and even touch Him but there is no great impact than for someone with extraordinary faith in the midst of pain encourages herself just to touch His clothes and be made whole? <strong>When I have a desperate situation it calls for desperate measure</strong>. <strong>Make prayers that causes heaven to be in motion and hell to be in chaos. </strong>Prayers that shows your total dependence on the grace and mercy of God.\r\n\r\nAll of sudden all attention is on a woman of faith. She was not even supposed to be there, she wasn't even looking for attention. Even more interesting, she wasn't even expecting Jesus to look around and be concerned with her life but there she was. She had touched His garments, she was made whole according to her faith and now the process is about to end. When she confessed that she was the one who touched Him, He turned around and said, <strong>\"Daughter, your faith has made you well, go in peace and be healed of your affliction\". </strong>Can you imagine being called son or daughter when you were hopeless at one point? His love goes beyond our afflictions and He does care about what we go through. If He was able to pause for a second when He was on a journey and attend to this hopeless lady, don't you think He will do the same for you? One last thing, if she touched His garment and was healed, why would Jesus tell her again to be healed? This was to let her know that it wasn't only a physical healing but eternal also, her sins were forgiven and complete restoration. <strong>Hebrews 11:6, “but without faith, it’s impossible to please Him…”, SHE TOUCHED MORE THAN HIS GARMENT, SHE TOUCHED THE HEART OF THE LORD BY HER FAITH.

              "<strong>Romans 8:31, “What then shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThere is nothing exciting as seeing God display His power in situations we have no control over. In the process of God displaying His power, the old silly devil does the same. We often get terrified of his power and find that we are not progressing. I want us to understand that the devil is powerful, no doubt. He has his way of performing magic tricks, no doubt. We cannot render him powerless but we sure can render powerless what he sends our way because of who is for us. God is amazing, He is not going about rendering the enemy powerless, He goes about showing greater power than the devil’s.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Exodus 4:2, “So the Lord said to him (Moses),” “What is that in your hand?” He said , A rod”</strong>. Pastor Phil in the past has talked about the foolishness of God being wiser than men’s wisdom, here we see God giving Moses a rod to use to deliver the children of Israel. Instead of God giving him an army, He gives him a simple shepherds' rod. Why is the rod so important, because <strong>Exodus 4:20 reads </strong>“<strong>And Moses took the rod of God in his hands</strong>”. In other words, he carried the power of God in his hands for every situation. Aaron being Moses’ spokesman sometimes carried the rod of God for Moses. <strong>Exodus 7:10, “So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, just as the Lord commanded. And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent</strong>”. If God is going to go against the works of the enemy, He will device something that the enemy tends to use and use it against him. God had told Moses that He would harden Pharaoh’s heart that He may display His greater power in those times. He cast the rod and it turned into a serpent, however the enemy also has power,<strong> vs. 11, “But Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers; so the magicians of Egypt, …for everyone threw down his rod, and they became serpents”</strong>. Many stop at this point because the power of God comes first and then the power of the enemy comes second, and both powers look equal. Here is the difference <strong>vs. 12, “…but Aaron’s rod (God’s rod) swallowed up their rods”</strong>. God’s power went far beyond the enemies’ powers and swallowed everything that had been presented. That is what God does for His children, as He is displaying His power, He will allow the enemy to display his and then swallow his. Instead of chasing and wounding the serpents, He took them out of the picture. What then shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us.\r\n\r\nHere is another encounter. In <strong>Numbers 21</strong>, the children of Israel had been complaining to Moses about leaving Egypt, God gets tired of their complaints and in <strong>Numbers 21:6, “So the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, and many of the people of Israel died”.</strong> This is what happens when Lord if not for us, we get bit by the enemy. As usual Moses gathered courage to go before God to repent on behalf of his people and in <strong>vs. 8, “Then the Lord said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live”.</strong> What a picture of the cross, God doing something big that renders the works of the enemy powerless. In the beginning they were powerful killers, but then God gives orders for a serpent to be made and put on the pole, a picture of Christ taking a form of sinful man yet without sin. This is a picture of Christ being the Savior of every mankind from death. As long as our eyes are on the cross, yes the serpents may be around and we can see them and encounter with them, but their power’s have nothing against us. Christ on the cross rendered his works powerless, <strong>1John 3:8, “…for this purpose was the Son of God manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil”</strong>. A time to destroy his works is now, a time to destroy him will come later. So when the enemy comes against you, don’t freak out because of his power, just let him know that God will knock him out and swallow him, God is setting him up for that. When he reminds you of your past, remind him of his future. IF GOD BE FOR US, WHO CAN BE AGAINST US FOR OUR GOD IS POWERFUL!!. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Corinthians 10:5, “Casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/blog.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5969\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/blog.jpg\" alt=\"blog\" width=\"236\" height=\"258\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nHave you seen on TV “Police chase videos”. It’s interesting to watch and sad at the same time. People trying to run away from the law because of what they have done. Instead of surrendering peacefully, they think they can outrun the law. The more they try to, the more they break other laws making it worse for them. You find that they are exposing other people to great danger by their reckless behaviors. Something fascinating, the police will not give up chasing until they have apprehended the suspects. It doesn’t matter how long it takes, they will add more force to the chase if need be until they’ve arrested the culprits. Let’s swing this to the spiritual.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe mind is powerful. The mind can create, form, imagine, expound, retain things. The eyes most of the time fuel the mind and the mind in turn retains what it has received and even make more to it than what was received or is already there. Murder, lust, depressions, confusions, fear have their roots in the mind because the mind is very powerful. It’s one of the hardest things to control just like the tongue. The mind becomes the battle field and the target for the enemy. The scriptures talks about renewing the mind which is to take something evil out and replace it with something good. A mind left to wander, is A WILD MIND ON THE LOOSE running from the law without yielding to the Holy Spirit to arrest it. As fast as it may try to run from the Holy Sprit, the more it damages by numbing the conscience. When Jesus spoke about lust as being adultery, it showed how the mind has also power to commit sin. Also it’s recorded in the 6th commandment, you shall not murder, but if you hate your brother or have in your mind to murder, you have already done it in your mind/heart even if you don’t do it physically. The mind creates a god it’s more comfortable with. A god who has no sense of moral and justice. Once again you can see that the mind is very powerful and needs control.\r\n\r\n<strong>2Corinthians 10:5, “Casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God</strong>”. Every thought that is not of God should be cast down. I would describe casting down as being able to sit on what is trying to control you. You may NOT stop some imaginations from appearing but you sure can stop them from living there. Martin Luther said, “<em>You can’t stop birds from flying above your head, but you sure can stop them from building a nest on your head</em>”. \"<em>IMAGINE you are driving down the hill at 120MPH, suddenly you try stepping on your brakes, you discover they are not working, a head of you is a big truck you see yourself colliding with\"</em>. How can you stop yourself from being killed? think about it for a sec, what options do you have to escape this horrible accident from happening? here is how to stop this accident, “STOP IMAGINING”. Remember I started with the word, “IMAGINE”. Imaginations creates worse things that haven’t even happened yet or building things that are not pure, it’s cure is to cast it down by stopping to imagine. It’s work is to try and take the place of truth about God’s word. <strong>Fear exalts itself in the mind and pushes God’s knowledge about victory out, lust exalts itself and takes out the knowledge of God on morals. </strong>The mind creates another image of God which is the false impression of who God is and that has to be cast down.\r\n\r\n“<strong>...And bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ”</strong>, you are your own police to arrest your mind (thought) from getting away. The police chasing will not rest until the person on the loose is apprehended so are the Christians, the mind on the loose has to be chased however far it goes, arrested, taken captive under the obedience of Christ. The mind that lusts, builds fear, confusion, frustrations has to be arrested to have a sound mind. A mind on the loose without control will do more damage not just to self but to others also <strong>2Timothy 1:7</strong>, \"<strong>For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind\" </strong>The Bible does not just talk about having a mind, but a sound mind, a mind under control, a mind that meditates on good things accepted by God. We all have warranty to arrest the mind, what are you doing about it? Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Chronicles 19:5-7, \"5Then he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, 6 and said to the judges, “Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment. Now therefore, let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take care and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, no  partiality, nor taking of bribes</strong>.\"\r\n\r\nHave you ever stood before a judge? This can be quite an intimidating thing, knowing a judge can make a decision that will affect you being innocent or guilty on a matter. A judge is to base their decision on the law. King Jehoshaphat made a real mess of things during his reign. Therefore, “…<strong>Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to King Jehoshaphat (king of Judah), “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord? Therefore the wrath of the Lord is upon you. 3Nevertheless good things are found in you, in that you have removed the wooden images from the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God.</strong>” The prophet condemned the alliance of King Jehoshaphat with King Ahab (King of Israel) as Israel was divided into north and south. In the days following King Ahab’s evil rule in Israel, God raised up Jehu (see <strong>2Kings 9:2</strong>) to completely destroy Ahab’s descendants. Jehoshaphat upon hearing from the Prophet Jehu set up judges, and instructed them to focus on three things:<!--more-->\r\n\r\nFirst he instructed them, “<strong>Take heed to what you are doing”</strong> They were judges who were given the jurisdiction to make judgments concerning the people of the land. They were given an awesome responsibility of power. To quote Uncle Ben from Spider Man, “<em>with great power comes great responsibility</em>.” A judge can literally have the power of life and death in his hand. His decision is final and therefore cannot be reversed. If a person is found guilty of a crime worthy of death, once the sentence is carried out, the verdict cannot be reversed as the person is dead! Hence to be commissioned as a judge is no small task.\r\n\r\nSecondly, he instructed them in their legal source and status stating, “<strong>…for you do not judge for man but for the Lord</strong>.” These judges were to judge others on behalf of God Himself. Hence their final decision (verdict), was in a sense God’s decision, therefore it was crucial to make right decisions. The Bible states of God, that He is no respecter of persons (<strong>Acts 10) </strong>meaning He is not biased because of one’s social status, etc…, God cannot be bribed. What could someone give God anyhow, money, power, authority, He has it all in perfection! They were to make right judgments, or better said, righteous judgments (<strong>John 7:24</strong>). How would they accomplish this? Check out the next point.\r\n\r\nThirdly, he instructed them about the Lord being with them, “<strong>who is with you in the (matter of ) judgment.”</strong> It is crucial to base a judgment not on one’s own feelings, intuition, social status, ethnicity, or mood, but on the law. There is no law higher or greater in all the land than God’s Law. The judges had to stay near to God and His Law in order to carry out their great responsibility of judging others and therefore make righteous judgments. Jesus said “<strong>Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment” (John 7:24)</strong>. This is why when we share our faith with others; we take them through God’s Law, not our own personal ideas or opinions of righteousness. I can’t walk up to someone that I don’t know and tell them if they are going to heaven or hell based on my eyesight. However, I can tell them what God’s Word says about the matter, and then agreeing with God’s Word tell them only those that repent and put their trust in Jesus will enter in the narrow way of Heaven, while all the rest will enter the broad way of Hell’s destruction. In doing so, I make a judgment, but I make a righteous one, because it is based on God’s Word, and not man’s word. We would do well to heed the instruction given to the judges by Jehoshaphat, and take heed to them in our evangelistic endeavors. Jesus instructed His disciples, “<strong>Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20  teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age</strong>.” Amen.\r\n\r\nFourthly, he instructed them, <strong>“let the fear of the Lord be upon you; take care and do it, for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.</strong>” The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, which one needs to make a righteous judgment. When one fears God, wisdom will guide one not to show partiality or accept bribes. One cannot sugar coat the gospel for fear of losing a job, losing a friend, nor with hold the gospel because of ethnic prejudice. Sin is upon all (<strong>Romans 3:23</strong>), and there is only One remedy for all (<strong>Romans 6:23</strong>), hence we must bring thus great gospel to all, in the fear of the Lord, by His wisdom.\r\n\r\nRealize that you have been given a great responsibility to take this Great Gospel into all the world, walking in the fear of God and by wisdom help people know the very judgment of God, who they will one day (sooner or later) stand before. This God will sentence them to Heaven or Hell, so the time to help people see God’s final judgment is now not later. Now go and be faithful to the call!\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled…\r\n\r\nPhil The Evangelist &lt;"

              "<strong>Psalm 3:3, \"For thou O Lord are a shield for me, the glory and the lifter of my head\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAfter talking to different people and looking at my life, I see that we are all fighting battles. This is not an occasional thing but a daily thing. It may be fought at different degrees and levels but the fact remains we are battling. Often times I sit and wonder whether what I am battling will ever come to an end. At times I feel like there is victory and then right after getting victory in one battle, another surfaces and the battle continues. If we could avoid battles, believe me, I would be the first one to avoid them yet we are not called to avoid but face them.<strong> I believe you can survive battles without offensive weapons as long as you have defensive weapons</strong>. If you just have the offensive weapons, I guarantee you will be exposed to more dangers because offensive will tackle mostly what you see while defensive tackles all corners seen and unseen.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nJoshua fought battle after battle as God gave him victory. There was no indication that there would be no battles to fight, all that God told him in <strong>Joshua 1:5 was, \"No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you\" </strong>The Lord would strength him to battle while He was a shield for him the rest of his life. An assurance \"<strong>no man shall be able to stand before you</strong>\" is like a sneak preview of the end of a movie you are about to watch about your life. Moses had been given the rod of God (shepherd which symbolized power) to deliver the Israelites but he said \"<strong>If Your (that is God) presence is not going with us, do not let us go from here</strong>\" I can see a man who had offensive weapon but would rather have defensive than offensive. How many times do we want the battle to stop when it's too much, instead of the Lord stopping it, He becomes the shield to protect us from all the fiery darts. <strong>Shields are not offensive weapons but defensive weapons</strong>. At times when you get weary from fighting, all you need is a shield. Let the enemy continue to throw his spears, swords, punches whatever the case until he gets weary. On the other hand, you will be resting under the shield getting your strength back to face the enemy. From the movie \"Rocky\", Rocky Balboa had something going for him. He would shield part of his body his opponent was punching. His opponent would use all the force and energy to punch his shield, and yes it did shake him a little but wasn't doing a greater damage. When the opponent was beginning to lose strength, that is when Rocky would retaliate. In the process of shielding, he was gaining strength and strategy. <strong>Psalm 62:2, \"He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defense; I shall not be greatly moved\" </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Ephesians 6</strong> talks about putting on the whole armor of God. We have guarding your waist with truth, breastplate of righteousness, shoding your feet with the preparation for the gospel of peace then in <strong>verse 16, \"ABOVE ALL taking the SHIELD OF FAITH with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one</strong>\" Assurance that God is present to protect us is our shield of faith. Having the confidence and trust in no one but God to save us. Nowadays people's first question when looking for a car is how safe is it? Yes they value the power, the fancy stuff but they would rather know the safety gargets that can shield them from serious accidents and save their lives. What do you prefer, more power or more safety? I want to wake up each morning knowing the Lord is my shield, He encourages me to know that He would be with me. When I run from the battle ground with my face looking down because of the disappointments, He will lift my head up with an assurance that He is present. If you've been craving for just the offensive weapons, be assured of how much you need the defensive above the offensive. <strong>Isn't it amazing how the Lord would give us offensive weapons but not defensive for He is that to us already<em>? “</em></strong><em>If Your presence will not help me start my day, Lord I'm positive I won't make it”</em>.

              "<strong>James 4:8, “Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat is the presence of God all about that Moses desired and so was David and the rest? There is something about His presence that makes one to see and deal with Him and things differently. In Genesis, Jacob had a vision, upon waking up, he said,<strong> “The presence of the Lord was here and I knew it not.”</strong> Moses said”, “<strong>If Your presence is not going with us, do not let us move from here (paraphrased)”.</strong> The children of Israel had the ARK of the Covenant which represented the presence of God. The bible calls Him<strong> Jehovah Shammah</strong> which means<strong> Jehovah Present</strong> and not absent. He is not coming or going, He is here, now, available, ready.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhat is the ARK in the bible?<strong> An Ark is something that affords protection and safety</strong>, therefore the ARK of God (Covenant) is<strong> a throne where Yahweh Himself was present in the midst of His people</strong>. The children of Israel cherished the ARK, it was a sign of God's presence with them. No enemy could subdue them in the presence of the ARK. <strong>To learn about the ARK of the Covenant eliminates one from thinking or treating it like a lucky charm or a holy object that you can rub and get whatever you want</strong>. He is present and He has His dwelling in our midst, and though people who do not know Him think that we are using Him as a lucky charm, they have a wrong understanding. <strong>We don’t worship God because of what He can do for us, we worship Him because of who He is. </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>In 1Samuel 4:10, 11, “So the Philistine fought, and Israel was defeated… Also the Ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, died.” </strong>The Philistines fought to capture this thing that had always been with the Israelites. They did not understand what they were messing with. All they cared about was capturing the ARK and having it positioned in their camp as a lucky charm. If it worked for the Israelites, they were destined to have it work for them. The problem was, they were treating the ARK as an “IT” while the Israelites treated the ARK as Him, a sign of reverence and respect. What finally brought about Eli’s death is the fact that the Ark of the Covenant was captured. He heard that his two sons had died but that did not nearly affect him like when he heard that the ARK was captured which meant that the presence of God had departed. His daughter in law was pregnant at that time, when she heard Israel was defeated, her husband and her brother in law killed and the ARK captured, she immediately gave birth to a child and died. She named the child<strong> Ichabod, saying, “the glory of God has departed from Israel.\"</strong> I've always wondered why God’s presence departed from Israel until I read this chapter in <strong>1Chronicles.</strong>\r\n<strong>1Chronicles 13:4, “And let us bring again the ARK of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.”</strong> David desired the<strong> presence</strong> of God while Saul desired<strong> position</strong>. During those times, people desired more of the Spirit, desiring the presence of God, having God fight for them and<strong> the more they gained positions (things), the more they began to lose focus</strong> and that is why they lost the ARK. Look at Paul speaking,<strong> Galatians 3:3, Are you foolish? having begun in the Spirit, and now are made perfect by the flesh?”</strong> You lost it because you moved from the Sprit to the flesh, from the presence to the position. David desired to bring back the ARK for they saw where they messed up big time and he desired to fulfill<strong> James 4:8, “Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.” </strong>You and I need to draw nigh to God by seeking Him and He will do the same. For us to do so, we need to cleanse our hands, and purify our hearts and choose whether we want the presence or the position. Blessings Ev"

              "<p><strong>1Chronicles 13:14, \"The ARK of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And the Lord blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had\"</strong></p><p>David while he had a high position thought he could do things his way including handling the things of God. Our position should not dictate how we handle the things of God, our obedience through submission is what opens doors for His blessings. We can gain positions without letting positions steal the presence of God by starting in the Spirit and staying in the Spirit regardless of whether we have positions or not. <strong>Positions are temporal but God's presence is eternal whether in our lives or not</strong>.<!--more--></p><p>It happened that as David and his men were bringing the ARK of the covenant home, he did not follow the proper procedure of handling the ARK. The Levites were the priests chosen to carry the ARK and be worshippers however David decided to continue to carry the ARK on a new cart as the Philistines had surrendered it to them on a new cart. David instead of disbanding how the Philistines handled the ARK, he continued with it. One man by the name of Uzza was struck dead by God when he reached to help the ARK that had stumbled while on the cart. Because David did not follow the proper way of handling the ARK, one man died. <strong>1Chronicles 13:12, \"David was afraid of God that day, saying, \"How can I bring the ARK of God to me?\" </strong>David recognized the mistake he had made, God wasn't going to be handled the philistine’s ways who abused the ARK since they brought it in for their personal gain. God has His way of being served and in as much as we may try to do it our way, it will not work. It’s <strong>His way or no way, His will and not ours</strong>. They were excited from the beginning about bringing home the presence of God, all of a sudden, the joy turned into mourning. David decided to leave the ARK in Obed-Edom's house who I believe was a Levite, meanwhile David went back home to inquire of how the ARK should be handled and this time to bring home the ARK the right way.</p><p><strong>1Chronicles 13:14, \"The ARK of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three months. And the Lord blessed the house of Obed-Edom and all that he had\". </strong>What a blessing to know that when His presence is handled right, He opens the windows of heaven and pours us blessings that we will not even have enough room to contain them all. <strong>This was not an earned blessing, this was a bestowed blessing</strong>. A man opened his house for the presence of God to dwell in inform of the ARK of God, which opened ways for blessings. The Lord says, <strong>\"Blessings, I will bless you\" </strong>but we have to allow Him to come in and dwell with us for the blessings to flow. Obed-Edom might have not had a great position but the presence of the ARK sure made him be blessed<strong>. Proverbs 10:22, “The blessings of the Lord makes rich, and adds no sorrow with it\"</strong>. This is more than the material richness, this goes for spiritual stuff, wisdom, understanding, discernment, character enlargement. The blessings of the Lord touches on every part of our lives.</p><p>Are you worried about position or His presence? Is the position more important to you than His presence? Do you want the blessings without the presence? As long as the ARK of God remained in Obed-Edom's house, God blessed him and his home abundantly. I desire the ARK always in my life, which means desiring God's presence every day. The Israelites did not enquire of the Lord during the times of Saul; I have purposed to go back to inquiring of the Lord even more because I need Him and I need more blessings.

              "<strong>Psalm 23:1-6, “ The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. 2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. 3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever”. </strong>\r\n\r\nPrecursor: David wrote this Psalm when he was an old man and reflecting back upon his life. After killing Goliath, getting chased by Saul, being King of Israel, committing adultery with Bathsheba, he reflected back upon all that he had been through in his life and penned the most famous Psalm, as a summation of the Lord in his life. This is written from a shepherd that shepherded sheep and then the nation of Israel.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want”</strong>- David was well versed in the life of a shepherd for that was his first role as a boy. He personalizes it by saying “my shepherd”. It was God who was leading him. The shepherd always provided all the sheep needed and the Lord was certainly no different.\r\n\r\n<strong>“He maketh me to lie down in green pastures”.</strong> A shepherd brings the sheep to green pastures because that is where the food is and they can lay down there comfortably. The Lord nourishes our spirit and hearts with His love and truth, which is more valuable than food.\r\n\r\n<strong>“He leadeth me besides still waters”.</strong> Shepherds would always bring the sheep to still waters because if they drink from running, rushing water the sheep could get swept away by the current. If the sheep fell, their wool would act as a sponge and drown the sheep. Surely our Shepherd leads us to places that we can spiritually drink of His living water that are still, and healthy. Jesus said if we drink of the water He gives we shall never thirst again, because the source never runs dry - praise God!\r\n\r\n<strong>“He restores my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake”</strong>. The shepherd cares for the sheep and helps them when they are sick or overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n<strong>“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me”</strong> The shepherd is there with the sheep through the most horrific times. <strong>God is certainly there because there is a shadow, which can only be cast from the light</strong>. His rod is there to count and discipline the sheep. God needs to discipline, and He only disciplines those he loves. The staff was to pull the sheep up when they ended up wondering away and the shepherd would find it hanging off a ledge. He would reach down and pull the helpless sheep up to safety.\r\n\r\n<strong>“Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over”.</strong> God can set a feast in the presence of our very enemies. The shepherd would anoint the nose of the sheep to keep a certain kind of parasite from burrowing up the nose of the sheep into the brain. WOW! We are anointed with God’s precious Holy Spirit to keep the enemy from getting into our head with things.\r\n\r\n<strong>“Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever”</strong>. All in all because the Shepherd stayed with David his whole life, all that God had to offer: His goodness, and mercy never left David. He was a man in the palace of the Lord, and would dwell in the house of the Lord (heaven) all the days of his life (eternally).\r\n\r\nApplication: Don’t focus on Death Valley, but rather the presence of the Lord in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nBlessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>2Kings 6:8-23, \"And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them\"\n</strong>\nOur God is a great God, something we need not to forget. He knows how to battle His enemies in the battlefield. He does not fight according to men's ways but His. There are days He battles for us and there are days He equips and teaches us to battle. Many times we may not be prepared for the battle but He is. We may be caught unaware, He is always aware. <strong>Psalm 46:1, \"...He is a very PRESENT help in trouble\".</strong><!--more-->\n\n \nElisha in our text was a prophet of God and not a warrior. I’m positive  he even knew how to use an arrow but he was feared of men in every land. In this text we see him as a prophet in Israel especially a time Syria and Israel were at war. What made a difference in Israel is that God was on their side which made Syria fear Israel greatly. Now I understand why Moses would not go anywhere without the presence of God,<strong> Exodus 33:14</strong>. God had made a covenant with Israel that He would fight and defend them. <strong>He would go before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire</strong>. Everywhere they went, they concurred lands because God was with them. Can you imagine everywhere you go and everything you deal with, your enemies become subject to you simply because the presence of God in you? I believe that I can go anywhere, be anyone God wants me to be and survive anything as long as His presence goes with me for without Him, I can do nothing, <strong>John 15:5.</strong>\n \nWe completely trust and submit ourselves to God’s sovereign will for His presence to accompany us everywhere we go; He is Lord of our lives. The bible says in <strong>Psalm 37:23, \"The good steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord.\"</strong> How can one order our steps and direct our paths if He is not with us? We constantly need to seek His presence that we may overcome, <strong>Proverbs 3:5-8, \" Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; 6 In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. 7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the LORD and depart from evil. 8 It will be health to your flesh, And strength to your bones. \"\n</strong> \nMoses could only deliver the children of Israel because the presence of God was with him. He was not a warrior, he did not have an army, all he had was a rod of a shepherd and the Lord. That is all God needed  to deliver the Israelites from their enemies. If you are ever going to do the impossible, it will happen because the Lord is with you. To continue, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Kings 6:8-23, \"And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them\"\n\n1John 4:4, \"Ye are of God ye little children for you have overcome them, for greater is He that is in you that he that is in the world</strong>\". Elisha was an ordinary man with an extraordinary anointing. There was nothing good in him but the Power and the presence of God, and so when you begin to see enemies scattered and put to shame, it is not because they are threatened by you, it is because of the One greater in you. The bible says, in <strong>Psalm 68:1, “Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered”.</strong><!--more-->\n\n \nIn the passage on <strong>2Kings 6</strong>, the king of Syria discovered that Elisha did not have an army, just his servant. Why would a king who learns that Elisha has no army send an army on horses and chariots to pursue  him? Of course they knew Elisha was not even wearing combat gear to face the Syria's army. They could have sent less than 10 people and they would captured him without any problem. I believe the reason why they sent an army is because of what they had seen in Elisha. The enemy had no chance as they knew whose Elisha was.\n\nWe face situations, facing the enemy of our soul and because we know  Him, we are at peace. It amazes me how we constantly bind an enemy whose existence is already threatened by the presence of our Savior. What did Jesus tell Peter, “<strong>upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it”</strong>. He said upon his confession, this truth, I will build my church and my people and the gates of hell yes will come, but it will not prevail.  Let's not forget who we are, whose we are and where we are planted.\n \nIn the morning in vs. 15 Elisha’s servant  wakes up, goes out  and behold there was a great army surrounding the place where he and Elisha camped. Now let's back up here for a minute, if you look in the previous vs. you find that Elisha knew things done or said in secret, he was a prophet. I believe he already aware they would be pursued and now surrounded yet he was still able to sleep peacefully till morning. What an amazing thing, the presence of God made him comfortable in a situation that would make his servant terrified if he was made aware a head of time. I saw this with Peter who was able to sleep peacefully in jail and so was Daniel in the lion’s den. This is where we are different from the unsaved, they can only sleep peacefully or be calm when they know for sure that everything is okay. Their peace comes when everything is going the right way, for us believers we get it in both ways whether things are good or bad for it's not even us but God within. God with us is God within us. \n\nThe bible says that <strong>\"the peace of God surpasses all human understanding</strong>\". Mark the word the “<strong>peace of God</strong>”, it's not even our peace but His peace. That is why I don't get surprised when I see some Christians go through things and yet they are still maintain peace, they should be worrying about it but they are not, in fact they sleep through it. I see the peace in them but I know it’s not their peace. My blood brother Andrew is in peace despite being on a wheel chair with spinal injury he suffered in January 2013. They told him that he may never walk again, that did not shake his peace. We visit with him to encourage him and we find him encouraging others at the rehab. A couple years ago my friend Pastor Paul had brain surgery and during that time, he was the most peaceful man I had ever met. He still had to go through treatments that were affecting him. When they told 10% tumor left in his brain and was dangerous to remove, he told the doctors, \"my God will heal me\", God with him and in Him gave him peace to ride it out. Today, that 10% is gone completely.\n \nHysterical people use too much energy trying to worry and fix stuff, however someone who has the peace of God inside has nothing to worry about. He can speak out peace because he has it in. Someone once said, \"NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MAN WHO DOES NOT HAVE TO DO IT HIMSELF\". I see that in Elisha and that is comfort to me. God is with us, to continue blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Kings 6:8-23, \"And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them\"</strong>\r\n\r\nTo add to the last previous part, let me add in <strong>Mark 4:35-38</strong>, vs. 35, Jesus had been teaching on parables, He then told His disciples to cross with Him to the other side. As they sailed by boat, <strong>“…a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. 38 But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow” </strong>\r\n\r\nComparable to Elisha, Jesus was aware that the moment they began crossing to the other side there was going to be a great windstorm. And knowing life threatening experience awaited them, He went down at the bottom of the boat and fell fast asleep. In the midst of the storm beating the boat and the water beginning to fill the boat, He was very comfortable in the storm and slept through it. Instead of His disciples remaining encouraged by the presence of the creator (Jesus) in the boat, they panicked and became hysterical.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHere is something for us to ponder on, how would you have dealt in the same situation? You have the storm beating and filling the boat with water while Jesus is in the boat? Would you have been like the disciples? Here are some things if they had considered would have made them comfortable in the storm. 1. Jesus (God with us) was present in the boat, which alone should have been comfort to make them comfortable. 2. Did they think Jesus could drown? He was (is) God. 3. Did they think the wind had power over Him? Their reaction indicate that was not in their mind, they went to find Jesus where He was a sleep and launched a complaint by saying <strong>Mark 4:38, “…“Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?” </strong>In the midst of the storm they felt left alone, hopeless and helpless with the assumption that Jesus did not care. Jesus cared that’s why He was present right in the midst of the storm with them. <strong>His presence alone was enough even if He did not act</strong>.When they woke Him up from His sleep, He dealt with the situation, He said, “<strong>Peace, be still</strong>”. <strong>The storm was not defeated when He spoke, it was defeated the moment He was present in the boat with them.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis should be an encouragement to us that when Jesus is in this boat (US), we can never sink and drown simply because He cannot drown. I know for myself when the windstorm comes the first thing is panic then try to find ways to calm the storm instead of calming my nerves and encouraging myself that Jesus is present in this boat. What a comfort we have that Jesus is ever present even the times we feel we are facing storms suggesting His absence. He has said that “<strong>He will never leave us, nor forsake us</strong>”, what a promise. “<strong>Greater is He that lives in us than he that is in the world”</strong>\r\n\r\nComing back to Elisha handling his servant vs. 16 <strong>\"And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them\".</strong> See how God works, He revealed to Elisha the army backing them up but He did not reveal the same to Syria the enemy. I believe that revealing to Elisha the army with them was to show him that God’s army (God) is ever present, <strong>He reveals and shows Himself so strong to those who trust in Him</strong>. God is with us and God is in control, we ask in His name, He acts according to His will, to continue, Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/the-lord-is-with-us-part-2of5-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lord Is With Us, Part 2of5, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/the-lord-is-with-us-part-1of5-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lord Is With Us, Part 1of5, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/i-am-persuaded-part-2of3-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">I Am Persuaded, Part 2of3, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/05/14/i-am-persuaded-part-3of3-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">I Am Persuaded, Part 3of3, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>2Kings 6:8-23, \"And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them\" </strong>\r\n\r\nAnd Elisha called on God to cause the Syrian men on chariots and horses be blind vs. 18. If someone was pursuing you then all of a sudden something happens to them, they will stop pursuing you and begin to worry or attend to what has just happened to them. Here we see men pursuing Elisha and because they became blind, their priorities changed, they needed to be led by someone. Elisha prayed his servant’s eyes would be opened and then he prayed that the Syrians Armies eyes would be made blind.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 19, \"Now Elisha said to them, \"This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek\". But he led them to Samaria\"</strong>. Very interesting if you think about it. The army knew of no man except Elisha and his servant were the only ones present with them. They knew who Elisha was and his voice the reason they came down from the mountain to capture him. When their condition changed, the eyes they could see by was gone. All blind, helpless and confused seeking help, Elisha offered to bring them to the one they were seeking, the one who happens to be offering them help. Once again I believe Elisha saw beyond the natural to see that these were misguided men who needed help and direction. May be no one had ever showed them kindness, love and acceptance, maybe where they came from they were trained to hate but here is an enemy who first brings them to a place where they discover they can do nothing of themselves and then offers to help them. We meet many people who at times are tough to handle or relate to, some are family members. Their attitude, character and the like makes it hard to work or be around them, they became our enemies in one way or another. If we were to see beyond the present to see that some are not actually enemies but poor misguided people looking for acceptance, affirmation, encouragements and love. I would rather not fight them but pray that God would blind their eyes from seeing the bad things they want to see in me and reach to that place where they become helpless and need someone to show them the way, kindness and love. <strong>Love covers multitude of sins</strong> the bible tells us. This where we ought to be different, Christ is with us and in us.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 21, \"Now when the King of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, \"My father, shall I kill them? shall I kill them?.</strong>.. Finally Elisha led these men to Samaria to meet the king of Israel, what happens when an enemy after you is handed over to you in a helpless state? revenge comes to mind. You have a chance to gossip, be mean, do evil and desire something worse to happen to the ones you would call your enemy, however you chose not to. You may have had those days when you had a chance to destroy your enemies and you came under conviction to drop your charges against them. <strong>The bible says love your enemies </strong>and that is true but at the same time we need to know the enemy we can love and the devil is not one of them. Vs. 22 So Elisha told the king not kill them. I would imagine the king’s his disappointment with Elisha, he may have thought something like this, \"<em>well if we can't kill them, we will make them our slaves or we will make them pay for having troubled us; how about making them suffer until they wished they were dead</em>\". <strong>Matthew 5:44, \"But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, and do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you\"</strong>. What a word!!\r\n\r\nIs it easy to forgive and love your enemies? Of course not, however it is a key to release. Elisha at his disposal could have destroyed these men. After all they came to capture him to destroy him. Instead of rending evil for evil, he chose to do something out of the ordinary, I will share the final piece in the last part. God with us enables us to see what we were blind to see and deal with people in ways our natural sense would not allow.

They set food before them, and not tiny little food but a great feast as the bible puts it. Read and you will discover, they ate, drank and had a good time and thereafter they were released to go back to their master and so the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel. Here is what we are encouraged to do, <strong>Romans 12:20, \"Therefore if thine enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him a drink: for in doing so thou shall heap coals of fire on his head\". </strong>Elisha was able to treat these men well because of God, and the more he also showed kindness the more the people around him became affected and they changed their ways too.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nDon’t we want to desire Him more so as to make a difference in people’s lives especially those we would have wanted to put in the enemy column? If the Lord’s presence was not with Elisha, he would have treated them the way the world would. If the Lord was not with us, we would be no different from the world. I see the same with Jesus as recorded in <strong>Acts 10:38, \"How God anointed Jesus Christ of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with Him\" </strong>Jesus had more enemies than anyone on earth, to make the matters worse, He knew them and yet He still showed them kindness and goodness. He had all the power He needed to destroy them yet He used the power to serve them why? because<strong> Acts 10:38 says, “…for God was with Him</strong>”\r\n\r\n<strong>Luke 6:27-36 “27 But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28 bless those who curse you, and pray for those who spitefully use you. 29 To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either. 30 Give to everyone who asks of you. And from him who takes away your goods do not ask them back. 31 And just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise. 32 “But if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. 33 And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. 34 And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much back. 35 But love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and evil. 36 Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful”. </strong>Elisha did all these expecting nothing in return for God was with him, may the Lord’s presence make a difference in our lives<strong>. </strong>Blessings Ev\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/11/the-lord-is-with-us-part-3of5-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lord Is With Us, Part 3of5, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/the-lord-is-with-us-part-2of5-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lord Is With Us, Part 2of5, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/the-lord-is-with-us-part-1of5-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lord Is With Us, Part 1of5, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/our-god-is-powerful-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Our God Is Powerful, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/blessed-because-of-his-presence-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Blessed Because Of His Presence, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/05/30/peace-without-pieces-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Peace Without Pieces, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Proverbs 29:18, “Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keeps the law, happy is he.” </strong>\n\nMy wife and I sometime back had some dear friends of ours over and in the midst of our conversations my friend Steve shared that he liked to read things that talk about the BIG picture.  Think of a puzzle for a moment.  Perhaps when you were growing up, you, like I did, found recreation in putting puzzles together.  My father taught me to set up the puzzle box in a way that I can always see the picture, and to always begin by laying out the boarder of the puzzle first and then to fill in the middle.  Each piece is important and living out the BIG picture takes time.  What can we learn about the BIG picture from putting together puzzles?<!--more-->\n\n \n1.   Always have the BIG picture in view.  “<strong>Where there is no vision people perish.”</strong>\n \nWhat is our life supposed to look like?  My dad instructed me through puzzle box, so I could have a point of reference to go by.  When one starts and finishes a puzzle it should start to look like the picture on the box.  To the sports fans, the scoreboard becomes the point of reference when the goal is winning.  Many have quoted the famous verse from <strong>Jeremiah 29:11, “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future…</strong>”  We have a God that always sees the BIG picture, a God that has a plan, a blueprint for our lives. Can we even see a glimpse of that plan in our lives?  Helen Keller the famous American author and educator who was blind and deaf, 1880-1968, said, “<em>The most pathetic person in the world is someone who has sight but has no vision.</em>\"  When we don’t have a vision, the BIG picture of things in mind, Proverbs tells us people perish.  The cross was a BIG picture of Noah’s ark, Jesus on the cross was the BIG picture of Isaac on the altar; Jesus’ sacrifice was the BIG picture of Yom Kippur “the day of atonement, etc…  Since the beginning (<strong>Genesis 3:15</strong>) God had redemption as the BIG picture.  Our point of reference, our “box to look at”, is Jesus Himself, and every facet of our lives should reflect the BIG picture. Thank God He sent us an example (<strong>John 13:15</strong>).  \n \n2.   Each piece is important, designed, and shaped to fit somewhere in the BIG picture “<strong>In his heart a man plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps\", Proverbs 16:9\n </strong>\nYou have an important place in this world, but the level of appropriating that is in your consultation of God’s will, and walking obedient to His plan. Your life successes or failures have a ripple effect on the BIG picture that God is trying to accomplish in and through your life.  <strong>Ephesians 2:10</strong> reminds us “<strong>For we are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</strong>”  God prepared in advance our place in the BIG picture of His plan.  An important question is “where do I fit in?”  For those of you that know, are you staying on that road, and can you see the BIG picture, looking back, and looking where you are now?  For those of you that haven’t answered the question, this is the very question, when answered which will give your life purpose and meaning.  Who wants to live a meaningless life?  “<strong>Thy will be done</strong>,” should spill from our hearts as it did from heart of Christ.  His will for you is in His Word, read it for yourself. \nTo be continued…\n \nApplication:  Do you have a vision, a BIG picture mentality?  How does God’s will fit into your plans, or how do your plans fit into God’s will?  Blessings Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Proverbs 29:18, “Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keeps the law, happy is he.” </strong>\n \n3.   Start with the boarder first of the BIG picture - “<strong>Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and your plans will succeed\", Proverbs 16:3</strong><!--more-->\n\n \nIf we commit our plans to God, they will succeed because God will have His say in them, and they will succeed based on our obedience to Him.  He may not agree with all of our plans, and after all He is the plan maker, we are to be His plan followers.  When we can make plans within His plans then they will succeed.  Because out BIG GOD has the BIG picture in mind.  God put the Old Testament like the border of puzzle.  Think of all the OT prophecies and laws and how the New Testament, FUL-FILS them, fully fills them.  But many people, like Peter, didn't see it.  Jesus told Peter, “<strong>Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men</strong>”.  Peter didn’t have redemption of the world, BIG picture in mind; he didn’t want Jesus to die.  Consider the Transfiguration, where Jesus was transformed, before the eyes of Peter, James and John the brother of James.  Peter said, <strong>“I will put up three shelters-one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.</strong>” While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, “<strong>This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!”</strong>  Moses represented the Law and Elijah the prophets, but Christ previously said <strong>Matthew 5:17 “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.</strong>”  God spoke the BIG picture out of heaven not with the emphasis on Moses, Elijah, and Jesus, but only on Jesus as He is the BIG picture of both of them, as both of them pointed to Jesus.  Peter focused on all three of them, because Peter didn’t see the BIG picture of things.  It’s easy to get sidetracked in life when our eyes do not stay focused on the BIG picture of things.  Do the roles and responsibilities that you have point to Jesus?  How do you treat your family, what kind of student are you, what kind of character do you emanate as an employer or an employee, etc…?  Those people in the Tsunami disaster were going to die anyway one day, it was tragic because so many died perhaps earlier than they would have and all at once.  The BIG picture is that whichever way we die; we will all stand in judgment before the KING.    \n \n4.   God has called us to live within the BIG picture in mind- Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed - <strong>Proverbs 15:22</strong>\n \nPlans fail for lack of counsel, because many people don’t receive counsel or advisors in their lives.  Do you have a board of directors of mature believers in your life who advise you about your life?  Can these see the purposes of God connected to your life?  God’s purposes are:  to give God pleasure in worship, to be part of God’s family in fellowship with other believers (genuine care), to become like Jesus and be discipled and make disciples, to use our gift and abilities to serve God in ministry, and to fulfill out His mission to evangelize the lost.  Are you doing these things?  Is the life you are living answering the question:  What on earth am I here for? \n \nThese purposes should be connected to your family, job, school, relationship, recreation, entertainment, etc….  Why, because living God’s purpose as the focal point, gives your whole life meaning and purpose.   \n \nApplication:  Is your life within the borders of God’s plan for your life?  Are you living each of God’s purposes in your life?  Are there advisors in your life to ask if that is true?  Give yourself an honest self-evaluation and ask your advisors what they see.

              "<strong>James 5:16, “…The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”</strong>\r\n\r\nMany times I’m asked to keep someone in prayers for financial breakthrough, healing, salvation, protection among others. And what a blessing to bring such needs before the Lord and I always do. A few years back the Lord began to deal with me about praying for needs, something bigger than what I was used to praying. Hope I can lay some groundwork first and then give examples from the bible about effective praying that avails much.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>I am constantly reminded that prayer is not so much about what I get but how I am changed by it and in it</strong>. And because prayer changes me, it changes how I approach God too for my needs and needs of others. For example, if you were to pray for someone’s salvation, how would you pray? You may pray something like this, “<em>Lord save my loved one, so that he can know you and go to heaven when he dies</em>” Nothing wrong with that, what I call an effective prayer for a lost one would be something like this, “<em>Lord awaken my loved ones lost in sin and rebelling against you, Lord help them see their sin, wound  their pride and ego, take away anything that cloud their minds and blocks their eyes even if it’s a good thing, that they may surrender to you in repentance and faith. Lord I’m not praying that you save my loved ones so that they can go to heaven, I’m praying that you save my loved ones for your glory, so that they can serve You, live for You, walk with You, and one day be with  You in heaven</em>” . The emphasis is more on who the prayer is all about, in this case, it’s about the glory of God through Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit. It’s easy to pray for salvation when you see how it will benefit you, “<em>if my loved ones are saved, I will see them in heaven; oh and the fights at home will stop; at least we can raise our children in the things of God as we would be in agreement; he can be better husband, treating me right etc.</em>”, all these are ok prayers, but not effective to avail much, why? <strong>James 4:3, “You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures</strong>”, either we do not ask for the right ends or not in a right manner, not in faith or fervency. There is amiss in those prayers that takes God off the focus and places the focus on the person you are interceding for. <strong>Where there is amiss, there is a drift.</strong>\r\n\r\nHow about praying for someone else who has a need. Instead of first praying that God provide the need, how about you pray that God establish their faith. If you are praying for them and they are doubting, how will that be effective? Jesus performed miracles based on the individual’s faith, God given faith. <strong>Matthew 9:22, “But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, “Be of good cheer, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour”</strong>. <strong>Matthew 9:29, “Then He touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be to you.” </strong>Their faith gave God the glory. In praying also, why not sometimes pray that in that situation God would grow them more in holiness, patience, establish their character, integrity, that the blessing may be more to His glory than for what it means to them and to you. Praying that His will may to prevail.\r\n\r\nIn our own needs we could be praying “<em>God get me out of this</em>” or pray effectively, “<em>Lord teach me to endure, teach me self- denial, help me learn all that I need to learn in my situation. Help me see the bigger picture than what I desire for you to do in my life</em>”. We often hear declarations in prayers “<em>claim it and receive it, blab it and grab it</em>”, that can be dangerous and this is why, you may not have any character and integrity to maintain the blessing. So what was supposed to be a blessing turns into a curse. How about we pray, “<em>Lord prepare me, show me my pride, my stinginess, build a strong foundation in me, help me grow in the fruit of the spirit, perform what is best  for Your glory</em>”. How you pray will reveal more of your motives, many times our motives are for selfish reasons. We therefore need to learn to pray effectively for ourselves and those we pray for. I will share on examples in the bible of effective prayers. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>James 5:16, “…The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat comes out of our mouths in prayer reveals what’s in our mind and heart when we pray. Have you ever asked yourself while praying, how would Jesus pray in and for a situation like the one you are praying for? <strong>Philippians 2:5, “Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus</strong>,” to have the mind of Christ will drive away any of our selfish desires that we may pray the heart of God in a situation rather than our own.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>John 11</strong> is the story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead. John tells us of Jesus' relationship to Lazarus, Mary and Martha (sisters and brother). John says, Mary is the one who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil. And when Lazarus was sick<strong>, vs. 3. “...the sisters sent to Him, saying, “Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.” ... Vs. 5. “Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus</strong>”. John stresses the word “love” for a reason. There was such a bond, such connection. Anything they may have needed the One who loved them would provide if they asked. Lazarus is now sick, they ask (pray) the Lord to come and heal. We would expect Jesus to rise up and rush to the aid of His friends He loved. Well, we are told He stayed where He was for two more days. Jesus knew Lazarus would die and He let him die, He did not even make it to the burial. What was the mind of Christ in this situation and how would others have processed all these according to His mind?\r\n\r\nLet’s find out why He did not respond to their prayer when they needed Him the most. He had a bigger picture in mind than what Lazarus’ sisters and others would have thought. For them a brother alive and well was good enough while Jesus had a different way of looking at it<strong>, </strong>Point 1. This was a situation that would allow God the Father to be glorified in it and so was His Son glorified through it, <strong>vs. 4. “When Jesus heard that, He said, “This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.</strong> Point 2. He wanted the situation to build the disciples faith far beyond healing <strong>vs. 15, “And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, that you may believe”. </strong>Point <strong>3. </strong>He wanted to show those who were present that He was sent of God and had the power to resurrect the ones He loves (salvation) <strong>vs. 41,</strong> “<strong>Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. 42 And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the people who are standing by I said this, that they may believe that You sent Me.” </strong>The sisters and the people who came to mourn did not have the mind of Christ otherwise they would have seen the bigger picture. Mary and Martha both said “<strong>Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died” </strong>at different times, <strong>vs. 36, “Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!” 37 And some of them said, “Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, also have kept this man from dying?” </strong>minds limited to the natural human thinking.\r\n\r\nJesus on the other hand wanted to pray the heart of the Father in the situation. How about when the devil desired to sift Simon Peter as wheat, the Lord did not rebuke the devil, what did He tell Peter, <strong>Luke 22:31, “31 And the Lord said, “Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.”, </strong>Again we see the Lord addressing a bigger picture. The bigger picture shows that it's way bigger than us and our needs. When we have the mind of Christ, our approach to effective praying would be through His eyes and not ours. Making prayers that are Christ centered and for it to be Christ centered, it has to begin with the mind of Christ because it’s all for His glory. To continue, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>James 5:16, “…The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”</strong>\r\n\r\nI believe that some people God has honored the most are the people who did not waste their trying times. Instead of blaming God or asking themselves and the Lord why they were in such situations, they began to praise and thank God for counting them worthy to go through it. Their prayers in situations like these changed as they saw an opportunity to pray to God to do something greater for Himself while they were in the situation. This is why I say, “<strong><em>don’t waste your trying moments</em></strong>”.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThere has been great persecution of believers in some parts of India. While we would want to pray for persecution to stop, you know what most of them are praying? That they will be bold to stand firm in their walk and in their preaching. What an effective prayer.  Why pray in this manner? they understand that through adversities, the gospel spreads like wild fire. The more the Egyptians oppressed the Israelites and even killed them, the more they multiplied and grew <strong>Exodus 1:12</strong> and so is India and many other countries where there is great persecution yet it’s not silencing the gospel.\r\n\r\n<strong>Acts 4</strong>, Peter and John are arrested for preaching Christ. They had just performed a miracle that started the trouble. They were then brought before the high priest and their family members, and with boldness, Peter preached Christ. Even with greater threat they still preached Jesus, (<strong>Acts 4:17-21)</strong>. How would you have prayed in this situation? probably for the persecution to stop, but they prayed in this way <strong>vs. 29, “Now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word”. </strong>They were not going to let adversities dictate what they could and could not do. They saw it as an opportunity to preach the word and their cry to God was for boldness. They refused to waste their trying period.\r\n\r\nThen we see Paul and Silas in <strong>Acts 16</strong> perform a miracle by casting out demonic forces out of a girl who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling (<strong>Acts 16:16)</strong>. The girl’s masters seeing their lost means of income, dragged Paul and Silas before the magistrate, falsely accusing them of many things. They were beaten severely, thrown in prison, their feet locked, and even having guards to securely watch them. In their situation, the bible says<strong> Acts 16:25</strong>, “<strong>At midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them”. </strong>What did they pray for, to get out? I doubt it. I believe they preached Christ and then prayed for the prisoners’ hearts to be softened to receive the gospel. Then <strong>“Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone’s chains were loosed.</strong>” , <b>Acts 16:26.</b> It appears their work there was almost done until the prison keeper awoke from his sleep, almost killed himself because he thought all the prisoners had escaped, but Paul assured him that they were all present. <strong>Vs. 30, “And he brought them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” 31 So they said, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household</strong>.” Imagine if they just sat there nursing their pain and complaining to God, they would have wasted their trial moments. Instead they maximized the opportunity to preach, pray, give praise to God through singing in which they led the prison keeper and his family to the Lord. They too refused to waste their trying moments. After it was said and done, I could see them saying, \"<em>it was worth the experience</em>\".\r\n\r\nYou could be sick and may end up in hospital, or are facing the worst trying time and feel like asking God the “Why” question, or feeling persecuted at work to name a few. What is your prayer when you feel like you are between a rock and a hard place? Are you going to waste your trying moments by complaining or pray to God to show you how to maximize every opportunity in that trying moment? <strong>James 5:16, “…The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much”</strong> , your effective prayer will avails much.

              "<strong>James 5:16, \"...The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much</strong>\r\n\r\nHannah in our text this morning had a loving and caring husband. She was married to Elkanah who also had another wife called Peninnah. We are not told who was the first wife of the two, we are only told Elkanah loved Hannah more than Peninnah for we see how they each got treated when it came to getting gifts <strong>Vs. 4&amp;5, \"And whenever the time came for Elkanah to make an offering, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife... vs. 4 But to Hannah he would give a double portion, for he loved Hannah\"</strong>. God had blessed Peninnah with the fruit of the womb, she had children while Hannah was barren for the Lord had closed her womb. You would think her joy would come from all these gifts. In life we always assume that people who have riches are happy because they can afford to have anything they want, but truth is many are very miserable.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHannah may have been ok with her situation until her rival Peninnah began to provoke her severely to make her miserable according to <strong>1Samuel 1:6, </strong>and I am not surprised for I saw this between Leah and Rachel, Jacob’s wives who had the same rival. Leah had children, Rachel did not, Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and therefore Leah provoked her daily and that made Rachel desire a child. Hannah was provoked so much that she desired a child of her own too. We too can be provoked by people around us to desire bigger cars, bigger houses, bigger promotions, bigger ministries or anything you could be provoked to want but the question is,<strong> what is the motive that drives you to pray</strong>. Yes they are good things you can desire to have but the motive for desiring them can be wrong. Do you want to be big to fit in, or feel better than someone else, or not feel rejected, or that let your pride get the best of you? Remember <strong>James 4:3, \"Ye ask and receive not, because you ask a miss, that you may consume it upon your lusts\". </strong>In other words, at times when we ask, it's for the wrong reasons, even something good. Hannah desired a child, question is, what was her motive? Did she want a child to get back at her rival, or did she want a child so that she could feel blessed too, or that she would not be attacked anymore? Any of the above could have been her motive and therefore year in year out she prayed but God would not answer her prayers. Don't blame God for not answering your prayers when you know for sure that if He answered them, you will not go to church anymore, you will not give Him glory, you will be prideful. God will not give you something He knows will destroy you until you begin to get your act together. Some people desire to be in a relationship, married, used of God, etc., the question is what is your motive?\r\n\r\nHannah may have revisited her year in year out prayers and saw how selfish her prayers were the reason God would not respond to such prayers. Then she prayed an effective prayer <strong>1Samuel 1:11, \"Then She made a vow and said, \"O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maid servant, but will give Your maidservant a male child, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, no razor shall come upon his head\". This is not about eloquent praying but effective praying</strong>. This is the type of prayer that supersedes our selfish desires and ambitions as we begin to see that anything God is going to bring our way is not for us but for many. He may entrust it in our custody but it's not for us. Her vow was for her son to be God's servant all the days of his life, I could imagine God saying \"<em>I’ve waited for you to pray this way for I now know for sure that honor and glory will come back to me</em>\". After she prayed this prayer, her desire was granted and more than she had asked for. She asked for a male child, God gave her a prophet <strong>Ephesians 3:20, \"Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us”</strong>\r\n\r\nNow I understand why many people cannot be used of God, they will love the praises of men and God will not get any of it. <strong>2Corrinthians 4:7, \"But we have this treasure in the earthen vessels that the excellence of the power maybe of God and not of us\". </strong>The bible says that our God <strong>is a jealous God </strong>and He will not share His glory with anyone. About 12 years ago God could not use me fully for every time He did something through me, I took the credit in the sense that when people thanked me, I responded \"you are welcome\" instead of saying “give God all the glory”. He began to work in me and then trusted me with the work again and the more I gave Him glory, the more He used me; the more I decreased, the more He increased because my motives were now right.\r\n\r\nWhen I pray now for a promotion, a better place to live, and to be used more is because I want to glorify Him in all things and others be blessed through the elevation for it's all about Him. My motive is to build a testimony that many may know that God is able. John the Baptist was told that Jesus was doing the work that John should have been doing, his response, <strong>John 3:30, \"He must increase, that I may decrease\". </strong>Because of Hannah's change of prayer attitude, Samuel is born to become one of the greatest prophets for he served many. Yes the mother rejoiced to have received a male child (prophet), God used His gift to the woman to reach many, God also blessed her some more <strong>1Samuel 2:21, “And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile the child Samuel grew before the LORD”</strong>. Rachel bore Joseph who became the No. 2 man in Egypt. What is that thing you have desire and prayed about? what is your motive? <strong>The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much\"</strong>. This concludes the series. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Mark 1:35, “And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed”</strong>\r\n\r\nDo you pray? When do you go to the Father in prayer, is it when you need something, when you are out of solutions, or perhaps when you have exhausted all your other resources and options? I think we can all testify that we are guilty at some level of a lack of prayer for one reason or another. Can the man that has a busy work schedule, or a mother busy with her children, or an athlete busy with his or her schedule use the excuse that there is simply not enough time?<!--more--><!--more--><!--more--> Funny isn't it how people can use the provisions of God, the job He provided, the talents He showered upon us, the relationships He blessed us with yet would He provide these things all at the expense of being in relationship with the very ones He calls His own children? We must pray, and I am not referencing those that claim that they pray all day long, whole driving, while at work, while walking, etc... Imagine having a relationship like that with your spouse, children, or a dear friend, how intimate is that relationship going to be if you are not actually sitting down apart from distractions together? If there was anyone that did not need to pray, but that certainly modeled prayer it was certainly our Lord Jesus. Mark records the routine prayer life of Christ in the first chapter and verse thirty-five of the book bearing his name. <strong>The ESV study Bible states, there are four verbs (rising/departed/went/prayed) [and thus might I add modeled which] emphasize Jesus’ resolve to have fellowship with his Father. </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rising-Prayer begins with desire and manifests in discipline. </strong>First, Jesus rises at a very early hour while it was still dark. He had just endured a rigorous day of ministry the previous day, but He nevertheless arises early to refresh Himself in prayer. Why? One must establish a discipline of waking up early, at a time free from distractions to enter into an atmosphere to get alone with God and get refreshed from labor whether it is ministry specific or not. Christ desired to be alone with His Father to be in intimate relationship with Him. Consider this: Christ never lost something that He needed to pray to find, He was never sick (as far as Scripture records) so He did not need to be healed from an infirmity, He didn't seek a prestigious occupation, actually He left His carpentry shop for the road ministry. He did not own His own home that He needed to beautify. He yearned however to be in intimate fellowship with His Father, and made provision in His life to do just that. Oh that I would have that same constant desire and yearning.\r\n\r\n<strong>Departing</strong>-<strong>Prayer begins with departing from others to enter into fellowship with the Father. </strong>Christ left His twelve disciples for a time being, the same ones that the Father gave Him (<strong>John 17)</strong> to raise up, and departed from their company so He could get alone with the Father. Perhaps if He would have stayed there He would have been distracted by the sounds of sleeping or perhaps, if I may use some preaching license here, snoring disciples. Perhaps He would have thought about the activity and even the shenanigans they displayed throughout the previous day as He looked upon them as they slept. Do you ever get distracted by attempting to pray where you are, perhaps in a room with a television, computer, or some other hobby or pastime your enjoy? Do you find yourself being drawn toward those other things rather than to the Lord? I ask these questions because I have been there. <em>“I just wanted to check my email real quick, to the neglect then of my \"knee mail\".</em> Would I prefer hearing from another or from the Lord? When Jesus asked the twelve if they were going to leave Him and depart like the false converts of <strong>John 6:66</strong>, Peter replied, “<strong>Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, 69 and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.”</strong> Do you and I believe that? If we believe He has the words of eternal life then why would we not depart to be with Him to glean those Words from the Father Himself in prayer through His Word?

              "<strong>Mark 1:35, “And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Going- Prayer causes one to go to where one can be alone with God. </strong>Businessmen take trips to meet with important people to be with than individual because some things cannot be handled through email, on the phone, or even through video chat. How much more important is the God that we serve, to get alone with Him, and seek him. It is true that one can meet with God anywhere, but one should establish a place as free from distraction as possible. It was Susanna Wesley mother of John and Charles Wesley that had nineteen children, but still would make it a point to get alone with God.<!--more--> Her kids knew when mom threw her apron over her head, you do not to disturb her because she was meeting with God. <strong>Jeremiah 29:12-14</strong> states, <strong><em>\"12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. 13 You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. 14I will be found by you, declares the Lord...”. </em>We must seek him, because if we do we will find Him!</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Praying-Christ centered prayer. </strong>Again if there was one that could have forsaken prayer, one would certainly think that Christ would be the one. After all He knew the will of the Father, and walked perfectly in His will. Yet He loved the Father and desired, departed, and went to have intimate fellowship with Him. One might set up one’s life in discipline, and then end up doing something other than praying.\r\n\r\nChrist was the Word of God in the flesh, yet still prayed. He showed the perfect balance of prayer and the Word of God. <strong>John 17</strong> records the high priestly prayer of Christ. However just prior to this, E.M. Bounds reminds us \"<strong><em>Jesus had just finished instructing His disciples (John 13-16)</em></strong><em>. Now He prayed for them, because prayer and the Word of God go together. If we have all Bible but no prayer, we may have a great deal of truth but no power. It would be \"light without heat.\" On the other hand, if we have all prayer but no Bible teaching, we are in danger of becoming fanatics-heat without light! Zeal is a good thing, but zeal without knowledge is usually destructive. A proper balance of Bible study and prayer is important to a balanced Christian life. \"Moreover, as for me,\" said the godly prophet Samuel, \"<strong>far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way</strong>\" <strong>(1 Samuel 12:23).</strong> Note the balance of prayer and the Word of God. \"And now I commend you to God [that’s prayer] and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up..</em>.\"\r\n\r\nWhen you are in prayer, you must be guided be the Holy Spirit but of course the Holy Spirit will certainly move and flow in perfect alignment with the Word of God. George Wood stated, \"<em>The Holy Spirit is like a river, and the sword of God is like the banks of the river. The river will never overflow beyond the banks of the river</em>” Make sure that your prayer life is bathed in the Word of God. I heard it nice said, \"<strong><em>if you read the Word if God you will have something to say. If you pray you still have the power to say it, and if you spend time with the lost, you will have an audience to say it to</em></strong>”, To finish, blessings Pastor Phil\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/effective-praying-part-1of4-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Effective Praying, Part 1of4, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/gods-presence-in-death-valley-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">God's Presence In Death Valley, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/effective-praying-part-3of4-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Effective Praying, Part 3of4, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/the-prayer-routine-of-our-lord-or-christ-and-the-discipline-of-prayer-part-1of3-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">The Prayer Routine Of Our Lord Or Christ And The Discipline Of Prayer, Part 1of3, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Mark 1:35, “And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Modeling the discipline of prayer</strong>. How was Mark able to write this verse when it is clear that everyone was sleeping when Jesus entered in this prayer discipline? In the succeeding verses is our main verse in <strong>Mark 1:35 </strong>we read, \"<strong><em>And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, 37 and they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you.” <!--more--></em></strong>How did they know where He was? Imagine that this was a routine of the Lord, and that there was a particular place that He would go to pray and they knew therefore where to find him at that time. However, what about, or perhaps this was the first time He did this? They searched and found Him in prayer, or to say another way, they caught Him praying. R.C. Sproul shares, \"<em>The verb used for their search is more better conveyed as the disciples were hunting high and low to find Jesus. And when they do find him they question Him in the form of a thinly veiled rebuke as if to say to Him, 'there is no time for you to pray, your fame is spreading and many seekers are awaiting you to minister to them, there is much ministry to do</em>.'\" The people wanting to meet with Jesus could care less about His prayer time with the Father and realize there are times when many will not care about your prayer life either. This unfortunately includes some leaders in the local church. Do you care more of using your gifts and talents that God gave you, even if your private spiritual disciplines of prayer and Bible reading are neglected? <strong>Oh how I have seen pastors place new believers quickly into leadership when there is no prayer life...what a tragedy!</strong> <strong>Many are more interested in what you can do, than who you are in Christ.</strong> This is gravely unbalanced.\r\n\r\nChrist modeled that ministry toward others, must begin with being ministered to by being alone with God you, prior to being effective for Him. What would someone catch you doing in secret? Would your children catch you on your knees in fellowship with the Lord? Would those in your church, or your discipleship group, when searching for you, discover you in communion with the Lord? Oh what an act to be found in, prayer! Oh that this would be me and that would be you. What an impact this makes upon others.\r\n\r\nMay you heed the realities of these initial four verbs (rising/departed/went/prayed and modeling) as exemplified by Christ, and may you too exemplify them as well.\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...\r\n\r\nBlessings, Phil (God's evangelist and servant)\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/the-prayer-routine-of-our-lord-or-christ-and-the-discipline-of-prayer-part-1of3-pastor-phil-sessa/\" target=\"_blank\">The Prayer Routine Of Our Lord Or Christ And The Discipline Of Prayer, Part 1of3, Pastor Phil Sessa</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/13/effective-praying-part-1of4-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Effective Praying, Part 1of4, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<b>Acts 3:1-16, \"16 And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all\"</b>\r\n\r\nWhy do we make faith complicated? Many preachers especially those of Word Faith make faith so complicated and so hard to reach. It is so complicated that it sounds like you have to do it right, you have to follow a recipe or a formula to get it right. This is often crowned with sow a seed faith to get your prayers answered. In other words, how you sow indicates what kind of faith you have. It almost sounds like you must have faith in your faith if anything is to happen in your life and many are miserable because they have been told their faith is not strong to receive.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe lame man in <b>Acts 3</b> believed and was healed, he gave nothing for his faith, if anything, even that faith to believe was a gift as we see later in the same chapter.\r\n\r\n<b>Faith in simple definition is trust or confidence in something or someone</b>. If you board a plane, how much faith do you need? The moment I board, I have already entrusted my destiny to the pilot because I have confidence in his ability to fly the plane. I don't have to see him, interview him, see his credentials etc. I just have to trust that he knows what he is doing. That is the faith that comes from knowing that the pilot’s mission is not to do evil but good and so is with our heavenly Father, <b>Genesis 18:25</b> tells us <b>“… Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (NIV</b>).\r\n\r\nLook at Joseph dealing with two of Pharaoh’s servants in jail with him. One day they both had dreams and believed the dreams had deeper meaning. Joseph seeing them asked why they looked sad, <b> “And they said to him, “We each have had a dream, and there is no interpreter of it.” So Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, please.”, Genesis 40:8. </b>Joseph had such confidence, trust, faith in his God to interpret dreams for others even when his was not revealed yet. Nothing could sway or taint his faith in his God.\r\n\r\nPeter explained how this faith works, he says vs. <b>\"16 And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know…”. </b>Christ name and through faith, indicating that the faith to believe is not something that just happens, it begins with Him and through Him<b>. </b>This is why<b> JESUS IS THE GIVER, AS WELL AS THE OBJECT OF OUR FAITH </b>and<b> </b>“<b>Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust…”, Psalm 40:4.</b>\r\n\r\nHe continues, “…<b>. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all\", </b>Christ is the author and perfecter of our faith. If by and through Him do we have faith to be saved, then by and through Him do we have faith to be healed, to be provided for, to be cared for etc., This is because we have confidence in God and that confidence is demonstrated when we pray to Him<b>. </b>\r\n\r\nWe therefore must pray by faith and entrust all in the care of our Lord then quit trying to build faith in our faith, robbing ourselves the ability to rest in the Lord because we are constantly wondering whether we are believing right. It was E.M Bound who wrote, “<b><i>Prayer is simply faith resting in, acting with, leaning on and obeying God</i></b><b>”. Pray, have faith, then rest in the Lord. Blessings, Ev</b>"

              "<strong>Acts 12:5-18, 5 \"Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church\" </strong>\r\n\r\nPeter in prison! What a jolt! We are too far removed from the actual scene to catch the atmosphere of dismay the Christians of that day felt.\r\n\r\nPeter had moved from Pentecost to prison, from jeers to spears. He was guarded by sixteen soldiers. One wonders why such a defenseless man needed such a group to watch him. Could it be that Herod feared the supernatural, seeing he knew that Jesus escaped such a group that guarded Him?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHad Peter been hedged in by sixteen hundred soldiers, the problem would not have been increased nor the escape less sure. Peter was bound not only by two chains, but also by the thick walls of the prison, by the three wards of the prison, and finally by an iron gate.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter is in prison, does the church organize a plan to get him released? No. When Peter is jailed, do the believers offer a plea to Herod or suggest a price to offer the lawmakers for his freedom<strong>? No. Peter had released others at the hour of prayer; now others must believe for his release.</strong>\r\n\r\nRight through the book of Acts, which might be called The Acts of Prayer, we find prayer and more prayer. Dig into the book and discover this power that motivated the early church. In the twelfth chapter of Acts we find a group that prayed. <strong>Though a host encamped against Peter, in this were these believers confident: there was a God who could and would deliver</strong>. The <strong>one never-failing rescue operation was prayer</strong>. There was no hedging about in the prayers of those who made intercession for Peter. Prayer was made without ceasing by the church unto God for him. They did not seem to be concerned whether Herod should die or not. They did not pray that they might escape Peter's fate. They were not asking that they have another exodus to a more hospitable country. <strong>They prayed for one person: Peter. They prayed for one thing: his release. The answer proves the point: \"Whatsoever ye shall ask,... that will I do\"</strong>\r\n\r\nSome shabby interpreters of this story have said that when the pray-ers heard that Peter was at the door, they were unbelieving. I cannot accept this assumption. I am sure that they prayed with expectation<strong>. I like to think that they were for the moment staggered by the immediacy of the answer</strong>. They could be excused if they raised their eyebrows when Peter said, \"I got out quite easily with an angel escort \" (Next time you pass through the magic self-opening door at your supermarket, remember that the first door to open of its own accord was operated from above!)\r\n\r\nAngel deliverances seem to find no place in our modern theology. Perhaps we would like the Lord to answer our prayers with the least embarrassment to us. After all, who expects that the angelic ranks should be disturbed just to bring deliverance to a praying soul? <strong>But supernatural results came for many of the praying saints of apostolic days. The Lord geared a property-damaging earthquake to get deliverance for an apostle. Prayer is dynamite.</strong>\r\n\r\nThere is no weapon formed against prayer that can neutralize it. Some things can delay answers to prayer, but nothing can stop the full purpose of God. \"Though it tarry, wait for it.\""

The same fate has befallen some of God's choice witnesses in Vietnam and in the Congo.\r\n\r\nSuch perils to other members of the Body demand concern, concentration, and consecration to a committed plan of prayer on their behalf. I fear that prayer has not been made to God without ceasing for these suffering kinsmen.\r\n\r\nMr. Bunyan shows us his Christian held captive by the Giant Despair in Doubting Castle.

But fetters break and dungeons fall when prayer is made by the church unto God-\r\n</strong>-Prayer without ceasing;\r\n\r\n-Prayer that might shatter our status quo;\r\n\r\n-Prayer that drains us of every other interest;\r\n\r\n-Prayer that excites us by its immense possibilities;\r\n\r\n-Prayer that sees God as the One that rules on high, almighty to save;\r\n\r\n-<strong>Prayer that laughs at impossibilities and cries, \"It shall be done\";\r\n</strong>-Prayer that sees all things beneath His feet;\r\n\r\n-<strong>Prayer that is motivated with desire for God's glory.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe praying of the believer can become a ritual. The place of prayer is more than a dumping ground for all our anxieties, frets, and fears. The place of prayer is not a place to drop a shopping list before the throne of a God with endless supplies and limitless power.\r\n\r\nI believe the place of prayer is not only a place where I lose my burdens, but also a place where I get a burden. He shares my burden and I share His burden. \"<strong>My yoke is easy and my burden is light</strong>.\" <strong>To know that burden, we must hear the voice of the Spirit. To hear that voice, we must be still and know that He is God.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis calamitous hour in the affairs of men demands a church healthier than the one we have. This blatant manifestation of evil in the youth and in the violation of God's commandments throughout the world calls for a faith that will not shrink.\r\n\r\nCan we let our prayer swords rust in the scabbards of doubt? Shall our prayer harps hang tuneless on the willows of unbelief\r\n\r\n-If God is a god of matchless power and incredible might,\r\n\r\n-If the Bible is the unchangeable Word of the living God,\r\n\r\n-If the virtue of Christ is as fresh today as when He first made the offering of Himself to God after His resurrection,\r\n\r\n-If He is the one and only mediator today,\r\n\r\n-If the Holy Spirit can quicken us as He did our spiritual fathers, Then all things are possible today.\r\n\r\nThe seas were boiling, the winds were howling, the sails were tearing, the spars were flying, the stars were hiding, Euroclydon was blasting. The people were cringing and crying, sobbing and sighing. One man alone was praising. All were expecting death save Paul. Amidst a scene of hopelessness, if ever there was one, Paul cries, \"Sirs, I believe God\" (Acts 27).\r\n\r\nAs things seem to fall apart these days, I am going to join Paul. I am going to say in faith, \"Sirs, I believe God.\" Will you join me?"

              "<strong>Hebrews 12:1, \"Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance (patience) the race that is set before us</strong>\"\n \nI believe that one of the greatest tests for a Christian is to be identified with Christ and maintain the identity. The moment you are labeled a Christian or identified with Christ, the moment  eyes are watching you. To this end it becomes difficult to identify with Christ when your words and actions ado not line up. We live in a world where bad news sells faster than good news and it takes one bad news to override all the good.<!--more-->\n\n \nAs believers, there will be those times we will stumble, get weak, weary, tired and even fall, however, we are overcomers because we identify with Him. When you know there are people on the lookout, you will strive to please God knowing that it’s by Him and through Him. Everywhere we go, we are to be Christians, Christ like. Yes we will have people waiting for us to fall but that shouldn't change how we feel about ourselves a in Christ. We are not out to please men, but God who raised us from things we couldn't raise ourselves from. Our display of His glory is not even to show that we are better than the unsaved, it is to show that we have found a Treasure. We ought not to be ashamed of who we are in Christ. When I look back where He pulled me from, I cannot but brag of Him before people. John the Baptist identified with Him and actually bragged about Christ, he said, <strong>Matthew 3:11, “ I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire”</strong>. How many waited to see John stumble? How about Jesus Himself? The Pharisees kept on trying to find fault with Him, tested Him but still they could not. How much more will we be faced with the Pharisees of today?\n \nThe bible says, \"<strong>Let us lay aside every weight\"</strong>, what are the weights that weigh a believer down, guilt, fear, doubt, failing to please people like you want to. Our aim is to please God through our (<strong>3W) Worship, Walk and Work</strong>. Anything we do, we do it to please Him, we shine to please Him as we also salt to please Him. We eliminate anything standing in the way of serving Him. God knows how to bring you where He wants you because He has confidence in His hands. People will only tell you of what they think but not do anything about it, God will do the opposite. \"...<strong>And the sin which so easily ensnares us</strong>\", we know of those sins that are easy to fall into over and over again that we got to deal with. Sin is simply doing what God does not approve off. Very easy to sin than to stay pure but God's standard still remains. What are we doing to deal with those sins that easily ensnares us?\n \n\"<strong>And let us run with endurance the race that is set before us\".</strong> God is not in a hurry. Yes there is a rush to get the sinners saved but when it comes to worshipping, walking and working with Him, He is not in a hurry. Ask Jeremiah who went to the Potter's house. The Potter was busy working on clay on the wheel. He happened to have noticed the Potter taking His sweet time working on that vessel. This is a long journey that requires patience in the race, fighting obstacles and barriers on the way looking towards the mark of the high calling. It is not a race to see who will get to the finish line first, it is a race that requires faithfulness till the end. Look at it this way, the marathon runners do not allow themselves to be distracted by the people lining by the road watching them, they have a number on the chest that identifies them in the race, they keep their eyes on the finish line. Do not allow yourself to be distracted on your race by the Pharisees. Lay aside what weighs you down, repent of the sins that easily ensnares you and then continue to run with endurance the race set before you as identify with Him. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Acts 10:5 , “And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname in Peter.” (Acts 10:5 - Full text all of Acts 10)</strong>\n\nYou’ve heard it said, never send a boy to do a man’s job. Well God says never send an angel to do a disciple’s job. Cornelius was a Roman Centurion responsible for the band of 100 men under his authority. The Scripture says that, “<strong>He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly (v.2</strong>).” Yet despite all of these great qualities he still needed to hear and know the way of salvation through Christ alone.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<!--more-->So what did God do to reach this devout Roman Centurion? An angel of God spoke to him in a vision and said, <strong>“Cornelius!” Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked. The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. 5 Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. 6 He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea</strong>.” WOW, this man’s efforts toward godliness were noticed by God, and God wishing for none to perish was going to make sure this man and his family knew what the real deal with reaching God was. Despite all of his efforts, none qualified this man to earn a seat in the Kingdom of Heaven, because those seats can’t be earned<strong>. “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9 not by works, so that no one can boast.”</strong> The gift this man needed was Christ.\n\nMy question is, why didn’t the angel of the Lord give this man the Gospel, but instead told him to send for Peter. Doesn’t that seem like a lot of unnecessary hoops to jump through when it would seem that it would have been much simpler to have the angel give Cornelius the Gospel? Who did Christ give the responsibility to bring the gospel to others to, His disciples or His angels? This account shows us the great responsibility Christ places on you and I to fulfill the Great Commission. In the movie Spider Man, Uncle Ben says, “<em>With great power comes great responsibility</em>.” If we have the Great power of the Holy Spirit in us, then we need to fulfill the great responsibility of the Great Commission. God could have saved Cornelius apart from Peter, but Peter was the mailman that was called to do his job, that of bringing the Gospel to this Gentile man. This should send a wakeup call to the Disciples of Christ to be active in going out to seek and save the lost by being witnesses unto Him and making disciples. Christ didn’t tell us to pray for the power of the Gospel to do its work, but for laborers to take the gospel to those that need it. And if they’re breathing and without Christ then they need Him! A farmer doesn’t sit inside the farm and only pray for a harvest. He goes out to sow seed so that he may reap a harvest. Peter went to sow the seed of the Gospel in Cornelius’ life and family, because the soil of Cornelius’ heart had been prepared for the Gospel.\n\nThank God the disciples didn’t stay in the Upper Room and just pray for the unsaved, but they obeyed the mandate to Go and seek and save the lost. Jesus last command should be our first priority. Is that true in your life? Paul reminds us, “But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.”\n\n<strong>Application: Lord send, not Peter but the one who is reading this devotion to someone that is ready for the seed of the Gospel to be planted in an unsaved life. </strong>\n\n<strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<b>John 1:46, “Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked. “Come and see,” said Philip. (NIV)</b>\r\n\r\nIt is troubling to know you can be misjudged, misunderstood, misquoted. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">The word \"miss\" is referred to when something is absent in the whole picture</span>. Not being able to hit the target or accomplish what one had in mind. It could be a piece of information or a piece of puzzle. What might not make sense to you could make sense to someone else simply because they have the other piece of information you don't have. You can type a whole sentence, a word missing or how you punctuate could change the whole meaning of the message you are trying to pass across. The other thing is to know the history of something and misjudge what it is capable of by looking at its history.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIt's fascinating to know that Jesus was referred to as Jesus of Nazareth. The King of kings was not even born in an earthly kingdom though he qualified. He was raised up in a normal town called Nazareth the home of Joseph and Mary.  Nowhere in Old Testament do you hear of Nazareth until you get to the gospels. Tying the pieces together as to how Nazareth would have been, it was no place for a king to be born, because it had no class and the people had no great fear of God. And to think that the person who would come out of it and call Himself the King was no other than Joseph's Son, a carpenter.\r\n\r\nPhilip finds Nathanael and he gives him the good <b>news vs. 45, \"...\"we have found him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\"</b> would you be excited if you heard that the person you grew up with or watched their life style could become someone extra ordinary? I would dismiss that too. When you know someone in and out and knowing where they came from, it can be hard to see far beyond because you've already dismissed them. Even today and I am guilty of this, I look at some people I know and dismiss what they can do. Ladies can look at men and dismiss them as not being good husbands (husband material), the same can happen to men. You look at a child who is growing up and all you see is a disaster and your comments, \"<i>you will never amount to anything</i>\", you have already dismissed anything they could be.\r\n\r\nWe have to be very careful not to dismiss people and things based on the little knowledge or information we have. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">As mentioned, one little tiny piece of information is enough to change the destination of what you see. </span>Nathanael could not see anything good coming out of an ordinary place even after Phillip told him. He was missing a very important piece to complete the puzzle. Are we not like Nazareth where Christ would come out of? Instead of sitting on the throne, He has chosen to dwell in our hearts (Nazareth)? He came right where we were in Nazareth to redeem us. He has chosen to be born in our hearts (Nazareth) the ordinary city. Did you ever think that one day you would be saved? Did you ever know that you would be used of God one day? Did you have people dismiss you and right out of you, Christ Jesus, Jesus of Nazareth comes out of you? You were dismissed because the piece, \"Christ in you\" was not seen. <b>Philippians 4:13, \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\"</b> could not be seen either. You might have been dismissed, that ought to humble you and I, God raises the least likely, the stones the builders rejected. He fills that life with His presence and lives His own life through a broken vessel. <b>1Corinthians 1:27, \"But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong\".</b> You always have to watch out for the one who has been dismissed because there is an anointing in his life and God uses such. Though Nathaniel dismissed Nazareth, when he met Jesus, he was not the same again.  Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>Genesis 39:1-22, \"So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house and in the field\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAs I shared the other day, we all love compliments, someone speaking good things about us before people. There is always a word that tends to erase every good thing someone has spoken. The word is \"BUT\". As long as good things are spoken without the \"BUT\", we tend to be ok with it but the moment it comes in the middle, then you become troubled by it. Your concentration on it erases all the good that has been said.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn the workforce, there are people who are hard workers, they do the best they can, and they are good at what they do. They give a 110% but no one ever notices, no words of appreciation, no pat on the back in fact most people concentrate on their mistakes and what has not been done more than anything else. With this they feel their presence is not significant. <strong>You have to understand that your presence is a present (gift) to your job</strong>. It may not be your dream job, you have to remember that God has called you there as a gift to that company, job, position, department to be faithful in it. Who knows, it could be a training ground to mature your character, leadership qualities, integrity, foundation, and be a blessing to others. God sent you there for a reason. <strong>Until you see it in a new way, you will be depressed instead of being in deep rest,</strong>. I remember a job I had before, I did not like it, I wished I could move away from it. I knew God had placed me there for a reason. I therefore chose to take the opportunity to serve and be the best at it, I did ministry there and it was a blessing. With time, the Lord moved. Your continuous complaints and whining will mess up every victory God had channeled your way. <strong>We forget many times that the world crowns success, God crowns faithfulness</strong>.\r\n\r\nLook at Joseph, his dream job was to be a ruler, people bowing before him including his family. As a young lad, that is the thought that consumed his mind. In our times maybe his dream was to be a CEO of a company. The thought of it and speaking of it almost cost him his life. He finally finds himself in a house of an officer serving as a servant (slave). Not his dream job but he is there, no one to talk well of him but he is there. He should be complaining and murmuring but he becomes faithful in his job. I believe that instead of asking \"why\", He was thanking God for the opportunity to serve in any capacity. As I shared recently, you ought to be your best encourager. If they don't say nice things about you, speak nice things to yourself. Applaud yourself for job well done. Look yourself in the mirror and say, \"<i>He loves me in spite of and He will use me to be a blessing in my job\".</i> \"It may not be where I want to be but if I can be faithful with the little, He will make me ruler over much\". <strong>You don't have to be liked and applauded to be successful, you got to know who you are, where you are going and who is in control to be one. </strong>That is what Joseph knew<strong>. A slave with a dream to someday be great yet beginning that greatness by laying a foundation of faithfulness</strong>.\" A slave with a dream but yet looking at his current situation as a stepping stone. If God promised him a dream, temporary setbacks does not mean denial. The bible says, “<strong>Do not despise the days of humble beginnings\" paraphrased. </strong>Faithfulness with time, resources, in responsibilities is what you and I need. Going an extra mile beyond the required duty. Extra mile is what I will call excellence mile, the mile that distinguishes you from others.\r\n\r\n<strong>Genesis 39:5, \"So it was, from the time that he had made him overseer of his house and all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was on all that he had in the house and in the field\". </strong>Can you see your job being blessed because your presence is significant? I believe my department, my boss, my colleagues; my surrounding is blessed because of my presence. I know that I am making an impact, it may be small but it's significant. Joseph's boss was blessed because of Joseph. <strong>If you are faithful over little, God will make you ruler over much</strong>. If you don't like what you do, I'm not saying be happy and relax, I'm saying be faithful in it as you trust God for greater things.<strong> </strong>I would stop for a moment and say, “what a privilege to be entrusted with a position like this”<strong>, Matthew 5:16, \"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven\". </strong>Your presence is Significant, therefore trust God and be faithful.

              "<strong>John 13:34-35, “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.” </strong>\n\nHow can one tell if someone is a fan of a particular sports team? Perhaps if one wears a\nteams clothing, jersey, hat, etc…. However if I put on a NY Yankee jersey does that mean that I am on the NY Yankees? Of course not! How then can one know if one is a disciple of Christ? Well one way to know Jesus said is that His disciples would have love one to another.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThis sounds very quaint, loving, caring, and mushy. Love as many have said is perhaps the most abused word in language. Jesus spoke to His disciples and gave them a new commandment, and that was to love one another as Jesus had loved them. Many feel that the love Jesus was speaking of here, is the demonstration of love that Jesus had shown them up to this point He was speaking to them. Jesus had shown them love, but He did not display His greatest act of love at the time He was instructing them to love on another. That display would be shown at the cross. Jesus would die for His twelve and for the whole world. This was the love that He was commanding them to love one another with. He said a new command, not a new idea, suggestion, or option I give you, but a new command. Jesus further said, “<strong><em>Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends</em></strong>.” Jesus was calling them to lay their lives down for one another. What is the reason that Jesus wanted His disciples to love one another as He had loved them?\n\n1. <strong>Christ’s Love is pure</strong>. John wrote, “<strong><em>How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God</em></strong>!” God is the source of love, and He lavishes that love upon His children as a mother lavishes love upon her child. His pure love, not love as the world gives, needed to be in their hearts if they were going to be Christ-like.\n\n<strong>2. Christ’s Love is demonstrative</strong>. The world sits in condemnation and judgment. The world is guilty of breaking God’s Law, they love darkness and hate the light. Jesus said that when His disciples shine their love toward one another, that the world would see it and know who Christ’s disciples are. The world can only see this kind of love if Christians step out of the four walls of the church building and live it out among all men. Many non-Christians have seen televangelists manipulate people for their money. Christ didn’t die in a church, He died in plain view of the people, in the sight of all men. Oh that we would die to ourselves that He would live in us, and we would be His feet and hands extended. I laugh when people say I love God, it’s the church I have a problem with. That is like saying I love you but I hate your husband or wife. Husbands and wives are one, and so is Christ and His body. His body must love one another, the church needs that love to flourish, and the world needs to see it as a living tangible witness.\n\n<strong>3. Christ’s Love is evidential evidence</strong>. Jesus said “…by this all men will know that you are my disciples….” When you live His love out loud, it shows that Jesus is real. Why would you go out of your way to help, give, bless, provide, even sacrifice for another brother or sister in Christ? because Christ is real. Why would you display the fruit of the spirit, bless those who persecute you, love your enemies? Practical Christian lives points to the reality that Christ is real, and the Savior of the world. Demonstrate His pure love today as evidence that Jesus is Savior, Lord, and soon and coming King!\n\n<strong>Until the nets are filled</strong>…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Matthew 10:40-42, “He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me. Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward. 42 And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward.” </strong>\n\nIn part one of Marks of a Disciple; we examined the new commandment Jesus gave to His disciples, to love one another as He has loved them. In light of that, Jesus speaks again about another mark being His disciple. Jesus starts off by talking about receiving Him.<!--more-->\n\n\n1. <strong>Whoever receives a disciple receives Christ</strong>. Those who treat His disciples bad, treat Jesus bad. Remember when the Apostle Paul, formally called Saul, was persecuting Christians? Jesus showed up on the road to Damascus, knocked him down and said, “<strong>Saul, Saul we do you persecute Me [Jesus]</strong>.” It was clear from the lips of Christ that those who come against Christ’s disciples are coming against Him, and those that receive His disciples, welcome Christ.\n\n<strong>2. Whoever receives Jesus receives God</strong>. God was the One that sent Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. Many Jewish people and others as well, want to reject Jesus but receive God. This simply can’t take place because Jesus is God. “<strong>Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” John 14:9 Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.</strong>” Jesus also said to the Pharisees, “<strong>’I tell you the truth,’ Jesus answered, ‘before Abraham was born, I Am!’ At this, they picked up stones to stone him</strong>,”\n\n<strong>3. Whoever gives a cup of cold water to the little ones is Christ’s disciple</strong>. Jesus is the living water that brings satisfaction to the thirsty. He said, “<strong>13</strong> <strong>Everyone who drinks this water [natural physical water] will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst, and “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. Vs. 38 Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.”</strong> In context of the prophet’s reward, and the righteous man’s rewards, there is the disciples’ reward here. Those that refresh Christ’s disciples will not lose their reward. Disciples of course have the living water in them, but even they need to be refreshed. The reason Jesus said that those who drink of the living water will NEVER thirst again is because the source will never run dry. Abraham’s well could run dry (<strong>John 4)</strong>, but Christ’s well can never run dry, because His well has always been full to overflowing with eternal life sustaining water. Will you share that water with another disciple today and so refresh their spirit. Please pray, encourage, and minister to at least one before the day is through. As God uses you to bring His living water to others, He will make sure you too are filled. Receive His disciples, receive Christ and therefore God Himself, and give some refreshing water of refreshment to one that is thirsty today.\n\n<strong>Until the nets are filled</strong>…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>John 8:31–32, “Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” </strong>\n\nI often hear that all one needs to do when it comes to salvation is to simply believe. Some take it a step further and use <strong>Romans 10:9 </strong>which Paul writes, <strong><em>“</em>That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” </strong>If one quoted this verse alone as the means of salvation, then it sounds like Paul is saying all one must do is to confess sin, believe Jesus and salvation is bestowed. However the key in this whole thing, Jesus is Lord. This confession was made publicly among other disciples. Then this new convert was disciple into Christian maturity.<!--more-->\n\n\nWhen the Apostle Paul was on his way to kill Christians, Christ met him on the road to Damascus and “…<strong>suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\", Acts 9:3-6. </strong>Did Paul confess Jesus as Lord? yes. Did he believe in his heart?, yes. Did he tremble with conviction of his sin? yes. Jesus confronted him with the Law, the sixth commandment, “thou shall not murder,” for that in fact was what Paul was doing to Christians. After this conversion took place, Paul said to Jesus, “<strong>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do</strong>.” Paul seemed to instantly know that he must now be a doer of God’s word and not simply one that hears, believes and confesses Jesus as Lord. Now he would have to live under the Lordship of Jesus Christ from this day forward.\n\nThe problem in many churches today is that preaching takes place, the pastor has people close their eyes and repeat a prayer of confession for sin after him. Then many times the person’s life does not change, and many times the person doesn’t return to the church even for a second visit. We call this type of person a false convert, because they have made stake to claims of salvation unto Jesus, but they wanted a Savior but not Lord. However the two cannot be separated, Jesus is Savior and Lord of my life.\n\nIn light of this, in the above key Scripture verse, Jesus spoke to the Jews who had believed Him. Therefore belief in Jesus was already present. Jesus then went on to say, “<strong>If you hold to my teaching, then you are my disciples indeed</strong>.” This is called a conditional statement because it uses “IF” and “THEN”, meaning IF you do this, THEN this will be the result. However IF one does not do this, THEN one will not get the same result. Jesus said one must continue in His word. The Expositors Bible Commentary says, “<em>Receiving his teaching would mark them as genuine disciples and would lead them into a deeper experience of truth</em>.” This learned truth then would liberate from legalism, superstition, and dead works of tradition which had developed over the years. Jesus felt the necessity of making perfectly clear the conditions of discipleship.\n\nAre you reading the Scriptures daily (continuing in His Word)? Are you obeying what you reading and showing Him to be Lord over your life? If you are then you are His disciple, you know the truth and have been set free, therefore REJOICE! If not then repent quickly, today, right now, and make the change that Jesus is calling you to make. If you are lord then He is not, but if He is Lord then you are not. Choose the latter. <strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Proverbs 24:16,\"for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again,..\" (NIV)</strong>\n\nOne of the most frustrating things is dealing with failures. There is no joy in knowing you have fallen or failed. Competitions have winners and losers, that is how it is set up. We cheer up for winners and we rejoice when we are winners but what do we do when we fall and or fail? You may be frustrated with yourself right now over failing to meet a deadline, or failing an exam, or failing to win what you hoped to win. What about failing to please the Lord with your life, fell in sin or sinned so bad again that you wondered if there was any more mercy left for you.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nYou have fallen many times and each time you asked for forgiveness and mercy and they were granted each time. This time you feel you have fallen too hard and too far and you do not believe any mercy is left on your God reserved personal account to be released to you. I have encountered some people who were so mad at themselves over how they failed, they would not even forgive themselves over the past failures. It is not like God had not forgiven them, God had and moved on but they found it so hard to forgive themselves over what they did. God forgot about it, but they keep reminding God of what they did. That is what is pulling them down and hindering their progression with God. Failing is part of life, we don't want to fail yes but at times it comes and we can either use it to advance ourselves by learning from it or use it to put ourselves down.\n\n<strong>Proverbs 24:16,\"for though a righteous man falls seven times, \". </strong>\"<strong>Though</strong>\" indicates that there is possibility, an indication that a righteous man may and will fall, and not ones but several times. We can trace its origin from Adam and all who came after him failed the test even before taking it. <strong>Falling is not an option</strong> however it does happen as you grow and as you walk to your destination, making choices that will lead you there. There are some things you have no control over that will either make you win or lose. The key is to realize that there are possibilities and what you do when you fall or fail matters a lot. Jesus understood that though His disciples were strong while He was with them, there was going to come a time when they would face challenges and even fail. In <strong>Luke 22:31, “31 And the Lord said, \"Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. 32, But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.\"</strong> Peter was not planning on failing but the devil was determined make him fail and Jesus knew it yet He did not even stop the situation from happening. All He did was to let Peter know what awaited him and what He had done for him in the situation. Jesus said to him, \"<strong>But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail</strong>\". In other words, everything can and may fail but when you have faith in God, that faith will cause you to rise up again and keep moving. <strong>You have enough faith in God to work with when the flesh fails</strong> and even when all you hoped and dreamed for fails. A righteous man falls seven times and he rises again because He has enough faith to work with. When one falls or fails, what happens? They still have enough pieces of things they need to assemble themselves back together again. Jesus told him, \"<strong>when you have returned to me</strong>\", this was an indication that his failure would move him further from the Lord but his faith in Christ will somehow bring him back to find the Lord and encounter with him again. God would use his experience to strength other brothers who would face situations like his.\n\nHave you fallen or failed? the bible says the \"righteous\" man not the \"wicked\" falls seven times but he keeps on rising because he has faith to pick him/herself up again. You can't keep crying over spilled milk, don't you understand you have enough to work with to get you back on your feet again? You have faith to believe that God can forgive you and faith to believe God can help you rise again and give you new avenues for progression. <strong>1John 2:1-2, “1 My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 2 And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the whole world</strong>”. John writes that we should not sin however if we do, we have Jesus to advocate for us before the Father. You only fail when you don't rise, therefore RISE, you have enough to work with, faith in God. Blessings Ev, God's servant\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/when-we-complicate-faith-for-nothing-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">When We Complicate Faith For Nothing, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/30/you-have-been-dismissed-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">You Have Been Dismissed, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Genesis 37:23, “So it came to pass, when Joseph had come to his brothers, that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors that was on him.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nPeople can take temporal things from us such as houses, cars, jobs, money, etc..., but there are some things that nobody can take. In the blockbuster movie Braveheart, William Wallace played by Mel Gibson Director of the Passion of the Christ was speaking to the people of Scotland that he was rallying together. He said, \"<em>Aye, fight and you may die, run, and you'll live... at least for a while. And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing' to trade ALL the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!\"<!--more--></em>\r\n\r\nOur enemies will try and take things from us sometimes those enemies may be our own family members or those that are close to us. This is precisely the predicament that Joseph found himself in twice during his life. Joseph was the favored son, and jealousy brewed among his brothers toward him. Eventually his brothers sold him as a slave and took the robe he was wearing. Joseph was unlike his brothers both in his attitude and character. Although they took his robe, they couldn't take Joseph's character or attitude from him. People can take the temporal things, but they cannot take the eternal things, such as our character from us.\r\n\r\nThen Joseph is brought to Egypt as a slave and his gift and godly character cause him to rise up in Pharaoh's ranks, second only to Pharaoh. He found himself in a compromising position with the Potiphar’s wife who wanted to have sex with him. <strong>Genesis 39:10</strong> reads \"<strong>And it came about as she spoke to Joseph day after day, that he didn't listen to her to lie beside her, or be with her</strong>.\" <strong>However, one day \"She caught him by his cloak and said, \"Come to bed with me!\" But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nLike Joseph's brothers, she took a piece of clothing from Joseph. When he ran from her he had his character and integrity fully intact, because she couldn't take that away, because it was not for the taking in Joseph's estimation. The only way she could have received it, was if Joseph gave it away, not an option in his mind. This is a lesson to take from Joseph. He was not giving up the character\r\n\r\nthat had been developed within him through his trials. I've heard it rightly said, \"<strong>Character is what you are in the dark, when no one is looking.</strong>\"\r\n\r\nJoseph teaches us:\r\n\r\n1. People (even those close to us) will try to take things from us.\r\n\r\n2. People may and can take temporal material things from us, but they cannot take eternal things.\r\n\r\n3. People can't take our character unless we give it away!\r\n\r\n4. God is more concerned with our character than our possessions.\r\n\r\n5. Our godly character is a staple of God working through our lives despite situations, status, or earthly possessions.\r\n\r\n6. God allows trials to build character.\r\n\r\n7. Your response to trials will reveal your character!\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...\r\n\r\nBlessings, Pastor Phil"

              "<strong>Luke 7:1-9, “And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was WORTHY for whom he should do this:” (KJV)</strong>\r\n\r\nA story is told of a little girl who looked outside the window of her house and saw a sheep and wondered how that sheep looked so white and clean. While still looking at the sheep, it began snowing. Before long, the sheep that looked white and clean did not appear clean anymore because the white crystal snow overshadowed the whiteness of the sheep and the girl thought how dirty that sheep looked in the light of the snow. Looking at it closely, you can see that she sheep did not change, the girl saw it under a different background, that is what made the difference.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn line with the story above, Jesus entered Capernaum and we are told a certain centurion had a servant who was sick. As you read more into the story, you discover that the centurion was a man in authority and under authority. He had servants he commanded and they listened and responded to him. He loved his nation and had built a synagogue making his resume impressive. When he sent elders of the Jews to speak to Jesus about his sick servant, the elders did not hesitate. They went to Jesus and even gave Jesus a good report about him. They talked highly of him and felt that he was WORTHY to receive healing for his servant. What strikes me is that they felt that he DESERVED Jesus' attention because of who he was, a man of reputation and what he had done. People were elevating him. In the background of his nation, he was a worthy man.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. “6 Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not WORTHY that You should enter under my roof”</strong>. How is it that a man who everyone deemed worthy considered himself unworthy? Simple, the background of the presence of the Son of God overshadowed his worthiness. He saw himself as that dirty sheep which looked clean before the snow came about. Of all the people, only Jesus was worthy. <strong>Revelation 5:2-5, “2 Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is WORTHY to open the scroll and to loose its seals?” 3 And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it. 4 So I wept much, because no one was found WORTHY to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. 5 But one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed (WORTHY) to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals.” </strong>When no one was found worthy, He was. The centurion knew that he did not deserve to have Jesus, the worthy One come to him or his house. The centurion continues to speak of his unworthiness, in verse “7 <strong>Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You”.</strong> His unworthiness humbled him to develop such a great faith on the One who was worthy. And we know his servant was healed because of the faith he had.\r\n\r\nWhen I think about my life and how so unworthy I was, reduced to worthless in His sight, I'm humbled. People buy things that are worth something, He bought me with the highest price when I was worthless. Now I am worth something, not because of me but because of Him who is WORTHY living in me. I will enter into heaven not on the basis of my worthiness but His. I thank Him for the chance to see myself in His background and not the background of men that I might repent and put my trust in Him alone for my eternal salvation. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>John 8:31–32, “Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” </strong>\n\nI often hear that all one needs to do when it comes to salvation is to simply believe. Some take it a step further and use <strong>Romans 10:9 </strong>which Paul writes, <strong><em>“</em>That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” </strong>If one quoted this verse alone as the means of salvation, then it sounds like Paul is saying all one must do is to confess sin, believe Jesus and salvation is bestowed. However the key in this whole thing, Jesus is Lord. This confession was made publicly among other disciples. Then this new convert was disciple into Christian maturity.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nWhen the Apostle Paul was on his way to kill Christians, Christ met him on the road to Damascus and “…<strong>suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: 4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. 6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?\", Acts 9:3-6. </strong>Did Paul confess Jesus as Lord? yes. Did he believe in his heart?, yes. Did he tremble with conviction of his sin? yes. Jesus confronted him with the Law, the sixth commandment, “thou shall not murder,” for that in fact was what Paul was doing to Christians. After this conversion took place, Paul said to Jesus, “<strong>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do</strong>.” Paul seemed to instantly know that he must now be a doer of God’s word and not simply one that hears, believes and confesses Jesus as Lord. Now he would have to live under the Lordship of Jesus Christ from this day forward.\n\nThe problem in many churches today is that preaching takes place, the pastor has people close their eyes and repeat a prayer of confession for sin after him. Then many times the person’s life does not change, and many times the person doesn’t return to the church even for a second visit. We call this type of person a false convert, because they have made stake to claims of salvation unto Jesus, but they wanted a Savior but not Lord. However the two cannot be separated, Jesus is Savior and Lord of my life.\n\nIn light of this, in the above key Scripture verse, Jesus spoke to the Jews who had believed Him. Therefore belief in Jesus was already present. Jesus then went on to say, “<strong>If you hold to my teaching, then you are my disciples indeed</strong>.” This is called a conditional statement because it uses “IF” and “THEN”, meaning IF you do this, THEN this will be the result. However IF one does not do this, THEN one will not get the same result. Jesus said one must continue in His word. The Expositors Bible Commentary says, “<em>Receiving his teaching would mark them as genuine disciples and would lead them into a deeper experience of truth</em>.” This learned truth then would liberate from legalism, superstition, and dead works of tradition which had developed over the years. Jesus felt the necessity of making perfectly clear the conditions of discipleship.\n\nAre you reading the Scriptures daily (continuing in His Word)? Are you obeying what you reading and showing Him to be Lord over your life? If you are then you are His disciple, you know the truth and have been set free, therefore REJOICE! If not then repent quickly, today, right now, and make the change that Jesus is calling you to make. If you are lord then He is not, but if He is Lord then you are not. Choose the latter. <strong>Until the nets are filled…Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;</strong>"

              "<strong>Genesis 21: 14-19, \"...Then she departed and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image3.jpg\"><img class=\" size-medium wp-image-6457 alignleft\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/image3.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"202\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nI would like to take a few moments to minister to the single mothers. Parenting becomes manageable when two parents are present to raise their child or children. Each parent has a responsibility in the life of the child or the children they have. There are things the Father will teach better than the mother and there are things the mother will do a better job than the father. So together they team up to bring the child in the fear and the knowledge of God. It becomes a greater challenge when the mother has to play both the role of the father and the mother in the life of the child or the children. Without the male figure in the home, how would they instill some of the Father like values?<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHagar, Sarah's maidservant was cast out by Sarah. She was forced to leave the home she had always known. She had a job that paid her dues. She had a man in her life Abraham she looked up to as her lord and master. She had all the protection she needed not forgetting the presence of people to comfort her. Trouble continues when after having giving birth to a son, 14 years later Isaac the promised son is born. She is cast out with her son because they were considered a threat. Having been pushed out, she was given a little bread and water and left to wander in the wilderness with her teenage son. Life is cruel right? someone wrote a book entitled, \"<i>Life is not fair but God is good</i>\". <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What life presents to you does not change the goodness of God</span>. His goodness does not depend on what you and I are facing every day. It may be tough and you may be thrown out like Hagar but He is still good. And some of you single mothers have come from having enough to barely making it. You are in some type of wilderness with no support, with less people to encourage you. You have a child or children to raise and cannot provide for them their needs, time, values like you would want to. You try your best and then there comes those times you throw your hands up and tears run down your cheeks. I have a message for you, <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">God knows where you are and where you are going.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Genesis 21:15-16, \"15 And the water in the skin was used up, and she placed the boy under one of the shrubs\". 16 \"Then she went and sat down across from him at a distance of about a bowshot; for she said to herself, \"Let me not see the death of the boy.\" So she sat opposite him, and lifted her voice and wept.\" </strong>Paul did everything he could do for the churches he wrote to. He had taught them, prayed for them, preached to them, guided them and after he had done all, he commended them to God.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">To commend is to commit to the care of another. </span><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What do you do when all you have done is all you could do?</span><b>, </b>commend it to God’s care. God gives you the ability to do your part then He intervenes to do His. Hagar had provided for her son, cared for him, protected him, was there for him. The new situation is so rough that she can't stand to see her son in this condition. In the midst of her situation, the Lord intervened, <strong>vs. 17-18, “17 And God heard the voice of the lad. Then the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, “What ails you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is. 18 Arise, lift up the lad and hold him with your hand, for I will make him a great nation.” 19 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the lad a drink. 20 So God was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 21 He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt”</strong>\r\n\r\nI know some of you mothers have done the same for your children. It has reached a time you have to release them but it's hard. Instead of worrying of what might happen to them when they are in school, play ground or any other place, commend them to God. Lay hands on them and pray for them. Praying for them is commending them to God. Commend your tough time to the Lord, Commend your less than enough to the Lord. Remember that God knows where you are and where you are going. God made a way where there seemed to be no way for Hagar and her son in the wilderness. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Before you even got to the situation, He already provided away out</span>. Commend everything to Him. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>2Chronicles 20:1-30, vs.12 \"O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s encouraging when you know what to do in a situation and what action to take. You can act based on the knowledge, ability and wisdom you have. But what happens when you find yourself in a situation where you just don’t know what to do? I mean you look at your knowledge, abilities, resources and wisdom and you see them as nothing compared to what is before you. Some of us have been in situations like that, one time auctioneers were at our door to take our stuff because we had a pending debt and we did not know what to do. We have had a few sick cases in our family we just did not know what to do. You may have things running through your mind even right now you recall you did not know what to do, or you are facing it right now. Lets see a man and his people who faced impossible situation.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>2Chronicles 20</strong> is one of my favorite chapters, it teaches me a lot about how God fights for His people and delivers them when they are in no position to fight for themselves. A message came to Jehoshaphat saying,<strong>vs. 2, “…A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and they are in Hazazon Tamar</strong>”. The great multitude the Ammonites, the Moabites, and others from Syria were coming AGAINST King Jehoshaphat and his people and they did not know what to do. A king who had troops reached a meltdown point where he just didn't know what to do.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of not knowing what to do in the physical realm, he knew what to do in the spiritual realm. He called on the King of kings, the Commander in chief of the armed forces, the Captain of all host<strong>, vs. 3, \"And Jehoshaphat feared,and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. 4 So Judah gathered together to ask help from the LORD; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD\"</strong>. Instead of summoning troops and trying everything in his own strength, he's number one move in the midst of his fears which is the first thing that hits us, he set himself to seek the Lord. He understood that if he did not know what to do in a situation like this, the King he reported to would. This is how we should handle situations that come our way with no answers. I know how easy it is to panic first and may be try other things but like Jehoshaphat, let's us first turn to the Lord. If I'm going to turn to the Lord, I'm going to count on Him to see me through.\r\n\r\nYou know what caused Jehoshaphat to come and trust God with this situation?, vs. 6-vs. 9<strong>, 1. He remembered God was the Lord of their fathers who had made promises to their fathers (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob etc.) and was going to keep them 2. He remembered that God was in heaven ruling over all the kingdoms including the kingdoms against them. 3. He remembered that in the hands of God there was power and might. 4. He remembered the former victories the Lord had given his people especially Abraham 5. He remembered God's promises that He will hear their cry.</strong> His remembrance and reminding the Lord must have boosted his faith to believe that if God did it then, He could do it again.\r\n\r\nWhat do we have to encourage us to trust in the Lord with our situations? His word <strong>Psalm 46:1, \"God<em> is</em> our refuge and strength, A very present help in trouble\", Psalm 3:3, \"But You, O LORD,<em> are</em> a shield for me, My glory and the One who lifts up my head\", Psalm 23:4-5 “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You<em> are</em> with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. 5 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;\", Psalm 37:23,\"The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you don't know what to do, call on Him who knows what to do. To continue, Blessings\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/the-lord-is-with-us-part-1of5-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lord Is With Us, Part 1of5, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/07/12/commend-it-to-gods-care-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Commend It To God's Care, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/the-lord-is-with-us-part-2of5-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">The Lord Is With Us, Part 2of5, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/shield-of-defense-is-present-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Shield Of Defense Is Present, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/i-know-because-i-know-him-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">I Know Because I Know Him, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>2Chronicles 20:1-30, vs. 12 \"O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIn sharing from this passage, you can sense Jehoshaphat’s plea to the Lord as earnest because he was a man in deep distress, troubled, however, it was not so much about him but for the people in his kingdom. When he purposed to seek the Lord you can see that he is assembling Judah and Jerusalem that they may all seek the Lord. I can imagine him praying, “<em>Lord for the sake of your name and these people you have given me to lead, please hear our cry</em>”.<strong> Instead of exhausting every means before calling on God, he called on God first.</strong> A few past chapters in<strong> 2Chronicles 7:14</strong> preps them for what they are about to face<strong>, \"14 if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAs we shared, king Jehoshaphat understood who God was, what He had done, what he had promised. One of the things he remembers is<strong> in vs. 11,</strong> where he says,<strong> “here they are (the enemy), rewarding us by coming to throw us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit</strong>”. He did not say \"OUR\" but \"YOUR\" possession. When you don't know what to do, remember what the Lord has done by reminding Him of His promises He has made in His word. This is not suggesting that the Lord forgets and we need to remind Him, this is for our benefit saying to the Lord that we remember His promises through His word.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 12 \"O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”</strong> In not knowing what to do, Jehoshaphat acknowledged his inability. One thing that I find tough to admit is my inability. Inability may give a sign of weakness. For us to come to the Lord, we are going to declare bankrupt and be vulnerable to admit like Jehoshaphat, \"<strong>we (I) have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us (me)\"</strong> and not be afraid to admit it. We are not going to pretend that everything is fine when they are not and live in denial. I know people may say “<em>stay positive, refuse to admit you have a problem or there is a problem and it will go away</em>”. There is nothing wrong with admitting you have a situation that is overwhelming and tough to deal with<strong>. Psalm 61:2, says \"From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I\"</strong>. Jehoshaphat also admitted \"…<strong>nor do we know what to do</strong>\"<strong>.</strong> Here is his encouragement in the midst of his confession<strong>, \"…but our eyes are upon You\".</strong> Remember Peter walking on water, as long as his eyes were fixed on the Lord he could not sink. <strong>Jesus did not change the surrounding for Peter to fit in, He changed Peter to fit in a surrounding that had turmoil and chaos</strong>. There was heavy waves rocking their boat yet he walked on what he could have been sinking in. When our eyes are upon the Lord,<strong> we can ride out what we could have been sinking in as we wait on Him to bring us through.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you don't know what to do, admit it and confess it to the Lord then keep your eyes on Him more than you keep your eyes on the obstacle. To continue.

              "<strong>2Chronicles 20:1-30, vs. 12 \"O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”</strong>\r\n\r\nJehoshaphat confessed this<strong>, “…But our eyes are upon thee”</strong> An eye of acknowledgement of humble submission to God. An eye of faith and entire dependence on God. An eye of desire and hearty prayer to God, An eye of hope and patient expectation from God.<strong> “In thee, O God! do we put our trust; our souls wait on thee</strong>.<strong>’’ Psalm 25:1-2, “To You, O Lord, I lift up my soul: 2. O my God, I trust in You: Let me not be ashamed; Let not my enemies triumph over me”</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhile all Judah (including the little ones) stood before the Lord to seek Him, a message from the Lord through Jahaziel came to Jehoshaphat saying,<strong> vs. 15, “Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle<em> is</em> not yours, but God’s”. Fear is the absence of courage</strong> which could result from threat of danger. Anytime the Lord planned to do something in someone’s life, you always hear Him deal with fear first. We all deal with fears at certain levels and degrees. This is one of the weapons the enemy uses to cripple believers because he is the captain of fear. Fear threatens faith, and God has given us what we need to combat fear,<strong> 2Timothy 1:7, “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind”.</strong> He told Abraham, Hagar, Joshua, the children of Israel, Elijah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Joseph, Mary, Paul, the disciples etc. to fear not, not be afraid because God knows that one battle his people have is the battle of fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being abandoned, fear of danger, fear of failing etc. This is why He dealt with fear first to get it out of the way that faith may prevail. The same message came to Jehoshaphat, God dealt with His fear then gave His word,<strong> “…for the battle is not yours, but God’s”.</strong> What a relief, what a blessing to know His words makes a difference.<strong> Isaiah 41:10, “Fear not, for I am with you; Be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand” </strong>\r\n\r\nIf the battle is the Lord’s, then we don’t need to fight and no need to go to the battle ground. There is no work for us to do there as they thought. Read what the continuous message was vs. 16,<strong> “Tomorrow go down AGAINST them. They will surely come up by the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Jeruel”.</strong> This would bring back fear in some of us. If the battle is the Lord’s why tell us to go against what brought us fear, the reason we came to Him in the first place? This is an indication we are not going in our own might and also, it’s an indication that we can fight scared without retreating or surrendering. It’s easy to want victory while sitting down, however I say, <strong>victory comes when you have sought the Lord and the Lord tells you to go against the impossible</strong>. It’s at this battleground that you see victories unfold before your eyes. It’s in this battlefield that you see the mountains melt like wax in His presence. All the people I mentioned before who were told not to be afraid still showed up in their own battle fields and so will we.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that the Lord told them to go against the army without preparation, explanation or strategies. Then He says, go against them but don’t fight just stand? Only God would say things that sound foolish and do not make sense and still be trusted.\r\n\r\nWhen you don’t know what to do and He tells you to do what you couldn’t do, be encouraged that He has a plan. The reason He is bringing you to the battlefield you want to run away from is to demonstrate to you His power. It gives a chance for the situation to know why God is present in it, not because of you, its in spite of you. <strong>Romans 8:37, \"Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us\".</strong> We only concur what He has concurred, that is how we become more than conquerors. How will you concur what He has concurred without your being present in the battle field where He is concurring? This is why I praise God and though fear is overwhelming me, I can still go against it fighting scared because I know He knows and I will see Him do things I never imagined or thought. To continue.

              "<strong>2Chronicles 20:1-30, vs. 12 \"O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”</strong>\r\n\r\nIt is fit that He who commands deliverance should command those for whom the deliverance is to be wrought, and give the necessary orders, both for time and place. He assures them that they should not be the glorious instruments, but the joyful spectators, of the total defeat of the enemy.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHere is the instruction when they come to the battle field<strong>, vs. 17 “You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, who is with you, ....”</strong> If you go to the battle field to meet your enemy and you are told you will not need to fight in such and such a battle, the moment the enemy sees you, he will be sure you have come to fight and he will retaliate. Here they are told, “<strong>POSITION YOURSELVES</strong>” get yourselves ready, not to fight but to see the Lord move. For the same Lord who said the battle is His is the same Lord who will claim victory over the enemy for Himself.<strong> Therefore you are in the battle field as a witness of the victory and a conqueror of what He has conquered</strong>. “<strong>Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, who is with you</strong>”, I could say “<strong>standing still</strong>” is more than standing doing nothing,<strong> I look at it as standing strong in your faith without wavering and seeing salvation come about even when it does not seem like there is one</strong>. The bible also says, “...<strong>Who is with you</strong>”, I find this fascinating because this line should build more faith to those who are in the battle ground. The reason being, the Lord of victory cannot fail in the battle field and neither can we if He is with us.<strong> Romans 8:31, “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? Psalm 118:6, “The LORD is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me?\"</strong>\r\n\r\nIn the story where Jesus was in the boat with the disciples makes this clear. While He was sleeping, the wind rocked the boat, there was thunderstorm, the wind was howling and everything was getting out of control. The disciples were afraid and thought their boat would capsize drowning them. If they only remembered that Jesus was with them in the boat, that should have built their faith even more, why? Ask yourself these questions<strong>, do you think Jesus in this boat could drown? how is it that He could sleep quietly in the boat with all the noise, boat rocking, wind howling etc.? He must have been peaceful to sleep through the storm. He also knew this was no march for Him.</strong> We need to sometimes stop and ponder over who God is and His words and speak like Jeremiah who said \"<strong>Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You\" Jeremiah 32:17.</strong>\r\n\r\nThey listened to the instructions<strong> vs. 18 \"And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the LORD, worshiping the LORD. 19 Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with voices loud and high\",</strong> Without asking if or how it will happen, they took God at His word, praised and worshipped Him with loud voices which sounded like the voices of victory. I believe they were still scared within their hearts but they were willing to step out by faith and one thing that was going to help them overcome fear is worshiping God. Allow His presence to build your faith, bring out verses to boost your faith, praise and worship Him as you wait, give Him thanks for the victory in advance, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. To conclude.

              "<strong>2Chronicles 20:1-30, vs.12 \"O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”</strong>\r\n\r\nJehoshaphat with his people rose up to go to the battle field armed with nothing but faith. Faith was their armor. A man afraid of the enemy stood to encourage himself and his people with these words<strong>, vs. 20” …, “Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in the Lord your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.”</strong> Instead of telling them to fight, he told them to believe God to be established and to believe His sent servants the prophets and they would prosper. This encouragement was not for one time event. That is true courage which faith inspires a man with; nor will any thing contribute more to the establishing of the heart in shaking times than a firm belief of the power, and mercy, and promise of God<strong>. Isaiah 26:3, “You will keep him in perfect peace, Whose mind is stayed on You, Because he trusts in You”</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTheir response,<strong> vs. 21, “And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the Lord, and who should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying:”.</strong> There is something about adding songs of praise to your faith. I believe songs keep faith a live as they remind you of who God is and what He is able to do. I have seen people sing when they were nervous which helped them calm down. Something happens when we sing praises to God in the midst of our situations. The world may teach you to sing and celebrate after the victory, here we are singing because He is Victorious. If they were not going to fight in this battle, they didn't want to be spectators. They thought, \"<em>why not praise God for who He is, His goodness, His mercies, His faithfulness etc.\"</em> and the bible says<strong>, vs. 22 \"Now when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated</strong>\". A big Amen. The moment they began to sing and praise the Lord, the Lord set an ambush against their enemies and caused them to destroy each other. If you come to a battle field where your fight is not required, break out into singing and praising God because breakthroughs also comes through praise and worship directed to God.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 24-29 \"24 So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and there were their dead bodies, fallen on the earth. No one had escaped 25 When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much. 26 And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed the LORD; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah until this day. 27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them,to go back to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies. 28 So they came to Jerusalem, with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets, to the house of the LORD. 29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel\".</strong> They did not see the fight in the battle field, they only saw the results. They knew God had defeated their enemies. <strong>They received double for their trouble</strong> and they came back rejoicing for the Lord had given them victory over their enemies.<strong>1John 5:4, \"For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world our faith”</strong> Only God could be faithful to do what they couldn't do and only God is faithful to do the same for us. Therefore call on Him, be vulnerable, set your eyes on Him, Heed to His word, have Faith, sing praises to His name. May we put to practice principles from <strong>2Chronicles 20</strong>.

              "<strong>Jonah 1-4, \"And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice\" KJV</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen you begin to read the book of Jonah, you discover that there is a specific task God gave Jonah to be completed. We are not told of who Jonah was, his calling, how he grew up. We are also not told of how he aged and died, we are only told of his assignment, his reaction and his action. I believe that there are certain times in life where God will give us an assignment. . Sometimes in 1998, I was given an assignment to pray for schools. During that time there was so much going on in schools and God laid a burden in some hearts including mine to seriously pray for schools. What I am saying is when God gives an assignment, He has already set up enough grace, strength and the ability for one to do it.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Chapter 1:1, \"Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that city, great city and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me\". </strong>We are introduced to some neat things in just verse one to which we will break it down as time goes by. The word of the Lord is present meaning alive everyday. It's always a now word for the Lord Himself is the Word. We hear Him introduce Himself as the<strong> \"I AM\" </strong>in the bible<strong>. Hebrews 4:12, \"The word of the Lord is living and powerful…\" </strong>we see it again as not a dead word or a word that will live but a word that is already living and this is the word that comes to Jonah. Number one point, the <strong>WORD </strong>coming, after the word comes, the first instruction in the word is <strong>ARISE. </strong>I would interpret as coming out of what someone has been in because of the word and making the first move by obeying the voice. Then <strong>GO</strong> which is to change locations by allowing a motion to take place.\r\n\r\nThe three, WORD, ARISE and GO are very familiar to us in the bible for we see the Lord constantly using them when getting ready to do something. He is always in the business of speaking and in His speaking there are clear instructions as to what is to be done. We also have this kind of calling in our lives where the word comes, we arise and we go. The bible says , “<strong>go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature</strong>”. We don't hear “<strong>sit ye”, it says “go ye”.</strong> My flesh loves the “sit ye part” but that is not the instructions. The words of the Lord are always action (doing) words for He is constantly on the move, He is always doing something and we are part of these things He is doing. Ready to move?

              "<strong>Jonah 1-4, \"And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice\", KJV</strong>\r\n\r\nWe looked at the first verse of the first chapter of the book of Jonah. We looked at three important keys <strong>Word, Arise and Go.</strong> Like I mentioned, there are times where God will give us a certain assignment to accomplish and if you know about assignments, they can be short term or long term but the key word to accomplishing the assignment is being <strong>faithful till the end</strong>.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nLet's look at what Jonah did when he received an assignment. <strong>Vs. 3, \"But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord...\" </strong>Jonah should have known very well that you can never run away from the presence of the Lord, God is ever present everywhere. <b>Psalm 139</b> talks of how God knows us from the beginning to the end, He knows when we sit and when we stand, He is familiar with our ways. David continues to say, “<strong>Lord if I put my bed in heaven, there you are, and if I put my bed in hell, there you are and if I took the wings of the morning and ascended to the uttermost parts of the earth, You will still be there”</strong>. Right now there are many who are trying to run away from God. They know they are being convicted of sin and instead of obeying the Lord, they have decided to run away from the presence of the Lord like Jonah. May I remind us that what God has designed for us to do, no one else will come and do it on our behalf. We can run all we want but eventually we will have to answer to that call. <strong>John 15:16, \"You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain\" </strong>We did not choose Him, He chose us for a reason and for a purpose. You might say, \"<b>well it's me who decided to follow Christ, I walked to the altar, I said the sinners prayer and I got saved\"</b>. The truth is, when you surrendered your life to Christ, He chose you, put the right words in your heart, convicted you and caused you to see that the things which you always thought were foolish were actually good news. The bible says, “<strong>a man cannot come to the Lord unless the Spirit draws him”</strong>. We can’t make people saved and declare them saved because they said the sinner’s prayer. The sinner’s prayer does not save anyone, it’s the Holy Spirit that does the conviction, conversion and gives assurance.\r\n\r\nJonah boarded a ship to go the opposite direction for he had his own good reasons for not responding to the call. Well everything seemed to have been going on well as planned by him but God will not let you do the opposite when He has a plan to save and deliver yourself and many. God wasn't going to allow Jonah to abandon the assignment and let a whole city go to hell simply because he did not want to do it (he wanted God to pass a judgment). So what did the Lord do, even in the midst of Jonah's foolishness, He demonstrated His power, number one to get Jonah know that He is sovereign over all and number two to turn the hearts of some men who were worshiping idols. <strong>vs. 4&amp;5, \"But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be brake. Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the luggage that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it for them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay and was fast asleep”.</strong> Our disobedience can make many suffer. We may be comfortable somewhere but someone somewhere will be hurting simply because of what we did or did not do. Remember in the OT, if one man sinned, the whole family suffered. Thank God, even the midst of our foolishness, God remains faithful. Watch something here, the men in the ship prayed to their gods, and their gods could not save them, they tried the human effort of getting rid of some stuff in their ship, but still that did not work out. We read in <strong>vs. 6,</strong> \"<strong>so the shipmaster came to him (Jonah), and said unto him, what do you mean, O sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not\"</strong>. Amazing right, we see men who never called on the true God, they meet a man of God for the anointing of God was upon him and they could tell that he worshiped the true God, they said to him, “<strong>call upon thy God”. Romans 10:13, \"Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved”, Psalm 18:3, “I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies\".</strong>\r\n\r\nI thank God that even in the midst of my foolishness He still shows Himself mighty around me and through me that many may know Him. Jonah may have not known that <strong>\"All things are working together for good to them that love God and to them that are called\". </strong>It will cost him dearly for the disobedience but the work will still have to be done and God would be glorified. Remember when David sinned having committed adultery with Bathsheba, even in his failure, God had prepared something good out of it. Yes He suffered the consequences but out of that marriage, Solomon was born to become the wisest rich man. God does not want anyone to fall but if we do, He has already prepared something good in the midst of our failure. To continue, blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Jonah 1-4, \"And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice\"</strong>\r\n\r\nAfter Jonah was woken from his sleep, the men in the boat cast lots to see who was the reason for their obstacles. Many knew that any time something was not happening right, most likely someone had sinned and the only way they could deal with it was to zero out the person and deal with that sin so as to have peace again. The situation would not change until the issue was dealt with. It's even with us today, many of our prayers will not be answered even though they may be genuine until sin is dealt with in our lives. <!--more-->\r\nWe cannot shout on top of sin, we got to deal with it. <strong>1John 1:8, \"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us\", </strong>meaning that if we say we have no sin, we are calling Him a liar. Sin for sure will hinder us from getting where the Lord wants us to be. Jonah began to explain how and why he ran from the presence of the Lord after refusing to take the assignment he had been given. The men in the ship were suffering for the sake of someone's sin.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 12, \"And he said unto them, take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you\". </strong>Surprisingly enough, he shared with these men he had done even being in a position to repent and allow God to forgive him but instead, he wants people to drown him. He is not even taking the responsibility of jumping himself, he want others to do it for him. The bible says the Lord is good and gracious, slow to anger, He rescues them that call upon His name. <strong>1John 1:9, \"But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us of all our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness\".</strong> Well we could say that Jonah was being tough headed but while we are at it, how many times have I messed up and when I had a chance to repent and be cleansed again I ignored and kept on trying to run away from Him? We have been talking of trying to run away from His presence but let's use something in the natural to strengthen it. When I was young, at sunrise, I would see my shadow just before me or behind me. Many times I tried to run away from my shadow but could never escape from it, it was always with me. When we received Christ, His light was shone upon us and we saw Him as He is and we can never escape His presence. You might say that I haven't seen the light yet, well His presence is always with you, the light gives the proof that He never leaves us.\r\n\r\n<strong>Vs. 13, \"Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land: but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them\"</strong>. Instead of the men even encouraging Jonah to repent and be saved, they tried their human effort to bring the ship to the land safely by fighting the waves. If God is in control and men want to be their own god, lead themselves to safety without His help, trying hard to do what only God can do, how will that work? I'm not surprised, we always do the same trying to do it in another way when we know the right way to do it. Trying to escape from the responsibility we need to deal with. Despite trying hard, they failed to beat God in His game and Jonah was thrown into the sea as he instructed. I ask myself a question here, was he willing to die just because of his disobedience? Are we willing to suffer more because we have refused to repent? God could lose His patience with those whom He has shown it all and have refused to repent and put their trust in Christ alone for their eternal salvation.\r\n\r\nWe know that “<strong>it's not by might nor by power but by His Spirit says the Lord”, Zech 4:6</strong>. In as much as we might try and fix it ourselves like the men in the ship, it will not work out for we are trying to fix the spiritual stuff through the flesh. To continue, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Jonah 1-4, &quot;And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice</strong>&quot;\n\nLet’s now see God’s act of mercy in preserving Jonah,<strong> Vs. 17, &quot;Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights&quot;.</strong> I have met people who blame God for what they brought upon themselves. People who did terrible things that landed them even in jail and yet they stood to blame God<em>. </em>They cry<em>, &quot;why did God do this to me or why did God allow this to happen to me?</em>&quot; It's the choice made by an individual that will cause them to either suffer or be safe. In this case, though Jonah brings all the calamities upon himself and deserves to die, in the midst of his foolishness God was still gracious to him and showed him mercy.<!--more-->\n\n\nNow you might say how was God gracious to him if He had prepared a great fish to swallow him? Someone may say, <em>“how was God gracious when he allowed me to go to prison or be down and broken?”</em> Here is something to ponder on, something worse than where you were could have happened but His hand of mercy kept you from the worst of worse. It's not that they could not happen, He kept them from happening. I am not better than those who have already gone to an early grave, the worst could have happened to me too but he preserved me even in the mess I was in. Jonah could have drowned without repenting and we don't know what could have happened to him in eternity. In the sea he could had been torn into pieces by other the sea creatures but God preserved his life by allowing a great fish to swallow him that eventually He would bring him to a place of repentance.\n\nJonah acted what Jesus would do many years to come. Even in his foolishness and not knowing what he was doing, he was acting what Jesus would do. Jonah being in the belly of the fish three days and three nights signified what Jesus did when He died on the cross and was buried. He was in the tomb three days and on that third day He rose again and became a victor over death.\n\nWhile we are still on the subject of being swallowed by fish, Jonah was covered by a lot of yucky stuff, his freedom was taken, nothing to eat, dark place, could not even move and he may have not even been aware of where he was apart from being in the belly of the fish. I think this is the time when people appreciate what they had before they landed in the worst places. A number of things could have been going through his mind in there. He had a chance to repent but he blew it, he almost drowned but God was still there to show him love and mercy. He began to evaluate his life and how he had made it this far by the grace of God.\n\nGod still loves His people and will always fight for them even when they fail because HIS LOVE IS NOT BASED ON WHAT WE DID BUT WHAT HE'S SON DID ON THE CROSS.<strong> Romans 5:8, &quot;But God demonstrates His love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us&quot;. In the midst of Jonah’s rebellion, God still preserved him. </strong>To finish. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Jonah 1-4, &quot;And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice</strong>&quot;\n\n<strong>Chapter 2:1, &quot;Then Jonah prayed to the Lord His God from the fish's belly. And he said:, &quot;I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice&quot;</strong>. Amen, out of the belly of the fish cried I to the Lord. Out of the mess I got myself into cried I unto the Lord and He heard me and answered me. God had every right to reject Jonah’s prayers but His love is an everlasting love and if we call on Him, He will answer us. <!--more-->\nBeing in the belly of the fish reminded him that God was always there with him and that is why he could call and be heard. That was a place of humility where he would say, &quot;Lord is not about me but about you&quot;, <strong>when you call me, I will answer; where you lead me I will follow; where you send me I will go; when you need me, I will be available and when you find me, I will be doing something for You</strong>. Read it for yourself and you will see how he was vomited and he takes the assignment with dignity and humility.\n\nSo why Jonah decide to run from the presence of God? Being that Nineveh was a wicked city, God had passed a judgment that the city would be destroyed in 40 days. Jonah's mission was to come and preach this message to a people who had mistreated his people. He was to preach judgment to his enemies and expect them to be destroyed but he knew better. He knew that if he preached, they would repent and God would grant them mercy, he didn’t want God to grant them mercy.\n\nWhen he was in his own mess that required God’s judgment, God granted him mercy instead of judgment. Mercy rejoices over judgment. The Ninevites needed to hear the truth and be converted and a man who understood God’s mercy was the man to bring the message. I believe with all my heart that we will never desire and have a passion to preach to the Ninevites (lost souls) until we have understood what we’ve been saved from, how we deserved the wrath of God because of our sin and yet in the midst of our rebellion, He showed us mercy, saved us and granted us everlasting life..\n\nDo we have to hit rock bottom to cry out to God? Do we call on Him when things are bearable? do we desire to see the lost come to a place of grace, mercy and pardon just as we did receive it, or would we careless as long as we are saved and going to heaven<strong>. HE HAS CALLED ME, I NEED TO ANSWER TO THE CALL</strong>.\n\nWhat is our calling? We are not called to be preachers, missionaries, pastors, prayer warriors and the like, we are called to be FOLLOWERS OF CHRIST, picking up our cross and following Him daily, dying to self, being crucified with Christ. The calling in our lives is to be obedient to God, to give Him the worship He deserves, to honor Him, to live a holy and righteous life. Being a pastor, preacher, missionary is a response to the call of obedience, it’s a demonstration of our service to Him. Blessings, Ev"

The name of the Lord and His work is seriously abused out here all done in His name. What is heard and elevated in the name of Christianity may be Christ labeled, the truth of the matter is, most are not <strong>CHRIST CENTERED.</strong> What is packaged and labeled with Christ's name is transported locally and abroad. Not long ago I came across one of the most influential pastors in America with a big congregation on TV, as he preached for half hour, I noticed that the bible was never opened or read, Christ name was not even mentioned once leave alone glorified, exalted, or even honored. He did quote some scriptures out of context and wowed the crowd with his man catered message on how to get along with everyone.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIf we are to get to the bottom of the gospel, the truth that must be revealed to all is that the Gospel is about Jesus, it must be cross centered, \"<strong><em>The bible places Jesus as the center of God’s plan not the sinner,</em></strong>\" Keith Green. Most of the preaching I see on TV is about the happiness of man, Martin Luther called it “<strong><em>the theology of glory</em>” <em>how can I climb the ladder and attain the glory here and now after God has promised us after we suffer.</em></strong>\" The good sound biblical teachings don't even make it on TV, if they do, they are very few.\r\n\r\nTo understand discernment from that which we are familiar with, let me use an example of a bank teller. The bank tellers are trained to identify counterfeit bills by getting acquainted with the real money. The more they spend time touching and studying the true ones, the better they can detect the counterfeit. This is the same with believers, you study the true gospel (God's word) and you will discern the false whichever way it's packaged or labeled and distance yourself from it.\r\n\r\nIn reading <strong>1Corinthians 1&amp;2,</strong> what I see in the first chapter is how Paul introduces himself then gets out of the way for the main character Jesus Christ to shine and outshine him. We see the messenger (Paul), his position (an apostle), his call (to follow Christ), his message (Christ and Him crucified) but the center of the opening verse is the person whose Paul is and that is Jesus Christ. In just chapter 1 alone, he mentions <strong>Jesus Christ 17 times</strong> in most of the verses and <strong>God 20 times</strong> in the 31 verses in the same chapter. I believe he did this deliberately to show that Christ ought to be exalted above all in every stage.\r\n\r\nThere was contentions among the Corinthians that brought about division, some were saying they were followers of Apollos, others of Cephas (Peter), others of Paul and others of Christ. They may have followed each of first three based on their teaching, leadership style, or personality. Paul comes in to show them that Jesus is the center of it all so that <strong>1Corinthians 1:31, \"...“He who glories, let him glory in the LORD.”</strong> for<strong> “... He is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell… ”, Colossians 1:18-19 (KJV).</strong>\r\nIn the next 5 messages following this, I will share a message by David Wilkerson inspired by Frank Bartleman based on a prophetic warning from Azusa Street 75 years ago, concerning the dangers of a Christless Pentecost!. Frank Bartleman was an eyewitness to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in 1907 at Azusa Street, Los Angeles. He has been characterized as the Reporter of the Azusa Street Revival. Nearly 75 years ago, during the outpouring, he wrote a tract warning of a Christless Pentecost. Stay Tuned. Blessings, Ev"

              "<strong>Colossians 1:18-19, “And He is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell… ” (KJV)</strong>\r\n\r\n“The following is a prophetic warning from Azusa Street 75 years ago, concerning the dangers of a Christless Pentecost!\r\n\r\nFrank Bartleman was an eyewitness to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in 1907 at Azusa Street, Los Angeles. He has been characterized as the Reporter of the Azusa Street Revival. Nearly 75 years ago, during the outpouring, he wrote a tract warning of a Christless Pentecost. He warned:\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n“We may not hold a doctrine, or seek an experience, except in Christ. Many are willing to seek power in order to perform miracles, draw attention and adoration of the people to themselves, thus robbing Christ of His glory, and making a fair showing in the flesh. The greatest need would seem to be for true followers of the meek and lowly Jesus. Religious enthusiasm easily goes to seed. The human spirit so predominates the show-off, religious spirit. But we must stick to our text - Christ.\"\r\n\r\n“Any work that exalts the Holy Ghost or ‘gifts’ above Jesus will finally end up in fanaticism. Whatever causes us to exalt and love Jesus is well and safe. The reverse will ruin all. The Holy Ghost is a great light, but focused on Jesus always for His revealing. Where the Holy Ghost is actually in control, Jesus is proclaimed the Head - the Holy Ghost, His executive.” In addition he said: “The temptation seems to be toward empty manifestations. This does not require any particular cross, or death to the self-life. Hence it is always popular.\"\r\n\r\n“We may not put power, gifts, the Holy Ghost, or in fact anything ahead of Jesus. Any mission that exalts even the Holy Ghost above the Lord Jesus Christ is bound for the rocks of error and fanaticism.\"\r\n\r\n“There seems to be a great danger of losing sight of the fact that Jesus was ‘all in all.’ The work of Calvary, the atonement, must be the center for our consideration. The Holy Ghost will never draw our attention from Christ to Himself, but rather reveal Christ in a fuller way. We are in danger of slighting Jesus - getting Him ‘lost in the temple,’ by the exaltation of the Holy Ghost and of the gifts of the Spirit. Jesus must be the center of everything.”\r\n\r\nI do not take Brother Bartleman’s warning lightly. The danger of a Christless Pentecost is very real today. I say to you it is possible to gather Spirit-filled people in one place, praising and lifting up their hands - and still have Christ walking among them as a stranger!\r\n\r\nIt’s true He said, “Where two or three have gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst.” (Matt. 18:20 NASB) But He can be in our midst as a stranger! Ignored, unrecognized - even by those who meet in His name! The Jews gathered every Sabbath in the synagogue to speak of His name, and to prophesy of His coming. They praised the name of the Father who promised to send Him. They spoke the Messiah’s name with awe and reverence. Then, when He came and walked among them - He was not recognized! He was a stranger to them!\r\n\r\nChrist, a stranger in the midst of a Spirit-filled congregation? A stranger in the midst of those who speak His name - who worship the Father who sent Him? A stranger to those who sing His hosannas who call Him “Lord, Lord”?\r\n\r\nYes! Absolutely yes! It is not only possible - it is happening among God’s chosen people today! to continue..."

              "<strong>Colossians 1:18-19, “And He is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell… ” (KJV)</strong>\n\nLet me show you three ways in which we are making Christ a stranger in our midst! May the Holy Spirit take away our spiritual blindness so we can once again see Him as He really is - LORD OF ALL!\n\n<strong>I. We Make Christ A Stranger - By Giving The Holy Spirit Pre-Eminence Over Him!\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<!--more--><!--more--></strong>\n\nChrist, and Christ alone, must be the center of life and worship!<strong>“And He is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell… ” (Col. 1:18-19 KJV)</strong>\n\n“That in all things He might have the pre-eminence… ” That is - distinguished and spoken of above all others. Having first place in all things. Not even the Holy Spirit is to be exalted above that name! <strong>The upper room must never overshadow the Cross</strong>! We dare not think of Christ as simply the One who sent the Holy Spirit. In other words, “<strong>Thank You, Jesus, for sending someone better.” Christ sent the Holy Spirit to reveal His own fullness within us.</strong>\n\nWhen the Holy Spirit becomes the center of our attention, the church gets out of focus! The Holy Spirit descended upon Christ as He came out of baptismal waters, and the Father said of Him: “<strong>This is My beloved Son - in whom I am well pleased . . .</strong> ” The Spirit descended bodily like a dove, but the focus was on the Lamb of God - <strong>who taketh away the sins of the world</strong>. <strong>Not the Dove, but the Lamb!</strong>\n\nChrist told His disciples of a coming Pentecost, when the Spirit would be outpoured for a single purpose: It was to be a power given to lift up the name of Christ!<strong>“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto Me . . . unto the uttermost part of the earth… ” (Acts 1:8 KJV)</strong>\n\nJesus made it clear that when the Spirit comes He will not draw attention to Himself, but will focus on Christ’s words. He will exalt Christ.<strong>” . . . when He, the Spirit of truth, is come . . . He shall not speak of Himself . . .He shall glorify Me: for He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the Father hath are Mine: therefore said I, that He shall take of Mine, and shall show it unto you.” (John 16:13-15 KJV)</strong>\n\nJesus said,<strong>“He will show you My glory, My power, My Kingdom. He will remind you of all My words.” </strong>The primary work of the Holy Spirit is not fellowship, although He does bring believers together as one in Christ. It is not ecstasy. It is not simply to teach us an unlearned tongue. <strong>The Spirit has come to exalt Christ!</strong> <strong>To guide all mankind to the truth that Christ is Lord</strong>! It is not enough to say the Spirit has brought us close to each other - He must bring us closer to Christ!

              "<strong>Colossians 1:18-19, “And He is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell… ” (KJV)</strong>\r\n\r\nPart two of I. <strong>We Make Christ A Stranger - By Giving The Holy Spirit Pre-Eminence Over Him!</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>We praise a Christ to whom we will not pray! We have become a praising people, but not a praying people. </strong>For many of God’s people the prayer closet is a relic of the past. “Why ask God for what He has already promised? Just get hold of the promises and simply command deliverances!” We no longer want Christ as much as we want what He can do for us. <!--more-->\r\nWe want an escape from pain and suffering. We want our troubles to vanish. And we are so caught up in our escape from pain, we lose the true meaning of the Cross. We refuse crosses and losses - no Gethsemane for us! No nights of agony! We don’t even know this suffering, bleeding, resurrected Christ!\r\n\r\nWe want His healing power. We want His promises of prosperity. We want His protection. We want more of this earth’s goods. We want His happiness. But we really don’t want Him alone!\r\n\r\n<strong>The Church once confessed its sins - now it confesses its rights.\r\n</strong>\r\nHow many of us would serve Him if He offered nothing but Himself? No healing. No success. No prosperity. No worldly blessings. No miracles, signs, or wonders. What if - once again we had to take joyfully the spoiling of our goods? What if - instead of clear sailing and problem-free living, we faced shipwreck, fears within and fightings without? What if - instead of painless living, we suffered cruel mockings, stoning, bloodshed - being sawn asunder? What if - instead of our beautiful homes and cars, we had to wander about in deserts in sheepskins, hiding in dens and caves? What if - instead of prosperity, we were destitute, afflicted, and tormented? And the only better thing provided for us was Christ?\r\n\r\n<strong>Very few of God’s people pray anymore! They are too busy working for Jesus to talk to Him! Ministers especially have become so busy doing kingdom work, they have little or no time left to pray.</strong> There is time to visit, to build, to travel, time to vacation, to attend meetings, time for recreation, reading, counseling - but no time to pray!\r\n\r\n<strong>Preachers who do not pray become promoters.</strong> They become frustrated building contractors. When they lose touch with God, they lose touch with their people and their needs. Preachers who don’t pray have egos that spin out of control. They want their own way. They substitute sweat for unction (anointing).\r\n\r\nEvangelists who do not pray become stars, storytellers. They lack humility, so they manipulate crowds through emotional gimmicks. The cry of many pastors is, “<em>Oh, God, where can I find an evangelist who doesn’t care about money, or who is not promoting something? One who can bring heaven down and make Christ real! Oh, God - give me a praying man to bring my congregation to its knees!</em> ” <strong>The shame of this generation is that we have too many talented men of God and only a few who have touched God in prayer.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>There is even less praying in the congregation! I’m 100% for getting prayer back in our public schools! But that’s not God’s real problem! His problem is getting prayer back in our homes! His problem is to get His own chosen people to pray! And you are a phony if you fight for school prayer and neglect secret-closet praying yourself!</strong>\r\n\r\nThe fullness of the Spirit is the fullness of Christ. If you do not have a consuming love for Christ, you do not have a Holy Ghost baptism! Christ, the baptizer, sent the Holy Spirit to fire our souls over lost humanity, to get us out into the highways and hedges to reach the unsaved. To shake up our lazy lifestyles and get us to doing His work. <strong>The blessed Holy Spirit will be grieved, and finally withdraw, the moment men try to exalt Him above the Son of God! He will not permit His power to be abused by those who want only the gift and not Christ, the Giver!</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat is a true Holy Ghost meeting? Is it where people all speak with tongues? Or where people are healed? Where saints jump for joy? Where saints are prophesying? More - much more than that! It is where Christ is being exalted, where His holiness pierces the soul, where men and women fall before His holy throne, broken, humbled crying, “Holy, Holy.” The moving of the Holy Spirit is a moving closer to Christ, deeper in Christ, with a greater submission to His Lordship!

For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell… ” (KJV)</strong>\r\n\r\nLet me share with you the second way in which we are making Christ a stranger in our midst.\r\n\r\n<strong>II. Christ Is Made A Stranger When People Praise Him, But Will Not Pray To Him!</strong>\r\n\r\nDo we pray? Oh, yes! When we need something. We have the formula down pat - “in the name of Jesus.” All we need Him for is to countersign our petition checks before the Father.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI am weary of hearing people say, “<em>This is such a busy age - l have no time to pray. I’d like to, but I don’t have time.</em> ” <strong>No! It’s not lack of time; it is a lack of desire</strong>. We make time for what we really want to do. Look at our Christian young people! Wasting hours of time playing Pac-man, Galaxy War, goofing off, bored, restless, looking for some action! But no time to pray! No time for Jesus! Oh, God! Somehow! Some way! Get this generation on its knees. <strong>Not just the Lord’s Prayer, but a daily communion with Christ.</strong>\r\n\r\nOur Savior, who has the care and concern for multiplied universes, has the time to pray just for you! He takes the time to intercede for you before the throne of God (<a href=\"http://bible.logos.com/passage/kjv/Heb.%207.25\"><strong>Heb. 7:25</strong></a><strong>), and you say you do not have time to pray to Him!</strong>\r\n\r\nWe work feverishly for a Christ we ignore. We will go anywhere, do anything, in His name. But we will not pray. We will sing in a choir. We will visit the sick and the prisoners. But we will not pray. We will counsel the hurt and needy; we will stay up all night to comfort a friend, but we will not pray. We will fight corruption! We will crusade for morality! We will stand up against nuclear weapons! But we will not pray!\r\n\r\n<strong>Most of all, we don’t pray because we really don’t believe it works</strong>. Prayer is a bloody battleground! It is where victories are won! A place to die to self! A place where a holy God exposes secret sin! No wonder Satan tries to hinder prayer! <strong>A praying man sends a shudder through hell.</strong> That man or woman is marked because Satan knows prayer is the power that crushes his kingdom. <strong>Satan is not afraid of power-hungry saints, but he trembles at the sound of a praying saint</strong>!

              "<strong>Colossians 1:18-19, “And He is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell… ” (KJV)</strong>\r\n\r\nThe conclusion will be long but worth it.\r\n\r\n<strong>III. Christ Is Made A Stranger In Our Midst When We Want His Power More Than His Purity!</strong>\r\n\r\nReader Harris, an Englishman and director of The Pentecostal League of Prayer, once challenged a congregation on this matter of power and purity. He said, “Those who want power, line up to my right. Those who want purity, line up to my left.” The congregation lined up 10 to 1 - for POWER!<!--more-->\r\n\r\nIn the book of Acts, <strong>Pentecost was synonymous with purity more than power</strong>. Peter told the council at Jerusalem what God did at the house of Cornelius, “<strong>God…giving them the Holy Ghost, even as He did unto us…purifying their hearts by faith… ” (</strong><a href=\"http://bible.logos.com/passage/kjv/Acts%2015.8-9\"><strong>Acts 15:8-9 KJV</strong></a>)\r\n\r\nWho is the man or woman of God who has power? Is it the one who can heal the sick and raise the dead? Is it the one who can best talk in tongues and prophesy? Is it the one who draws the most people and builds the greatest church? No! The one with the power - is the one with the purity! <strong>“… the righteous are bold as a lion.. ” (</strong><a href=\"http://bible.logos.com/passage/kjv/Proverbs%2028.1\"><strong>Proverbs 28:1 KJV</strong></a><strong>)</strong>\r\n\r\nThe prophet Malachi prophesied of a supernatural purge coming to God’s house<strong>. ” . . . the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His temple. .. but who may abide the day of His coming? And who shall stand when He appeareth? For He is like a refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap. And He shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.” (</strong><a href=\"http://bible.logos.com/passage/kjv/Malachi%203.1-3\"><strong>Malachi 3:1-3 KJV</strong></a><strong>)</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is a dual prophecy. He speaks of Christ’s first coming, and also of His second! He will come again suddenly, as a thief in the night. <strong>But first, He will purify His Church.</strong>\r\n\r\nWe are not ready for the coming of Christ! Is this the Church triumphant? Covetous. divorcing, depressed, worldly-minded, grasping for materialism and success, competitive, lukewarm, adulterous, rich and increased with goods, unaware of spiritual blindness and poverty, pleasure-loving, recreation-minded, consumed with sports, politics, and power - is this the Church Jesus is coming for? Simply coping, filled with fear and anxiety, satisfied only to have good health and happiness?\r\n\r\nMy Bible says He is coming back for an overcoming Church! A Church without spot or wrinkle! A people whose affections are on things above! A people with clean hands and pure hearts. A people who are looking for His coming! A people with a “new Jerusalem state of mind.”\r\n\r\nThe question is no longer, <strong>“What can my faith get me? What miracle will He perform for me?” </strong>The question now is - <strong>“How shall I stand before Him? How shall I make it at the Judgment?” ” . . . who shall stand when He appeareth?” (</strong><a href=\"http://bible.logos.com/passage/kjv/Malachi%203.2\"><strong>Malachi 3:2 KJV</strong></a><strong>)</strong>\r\n\r\nThe question is no longer, “How do I feel - how do I get happiness? How do I get the desire of my heart?” The question is - “Can I withstand that moment when I stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ? How can I withstand when I’ve lived so carelessly, so selfishly, so neglectful of His great salvation?” The central issue now has nothing to do with this world at all. At issue is - “<strong>HAVE I NEGLECTED CHRIST IN THIS MIDNIGHT HOUR?”</strong>\r\n\r\nThe purge is going to begin in the pulpit! <strong>” . . . He shall purify the sons of Levi… ” (</strong><a href=\"http://bible.logos.com/passage/kjv/Malachi%203.3\"><strong>Malachi 3:3 KJV</strong></a><strong>) </strong>God is going to accomplish that by “turning up the heat.” God is going to make things so hot, so fiery, so intense, God’s men will be driven to their knees! This is the fire of the Holy Ghost! It is the fire of persecution. It is the fire of tribulation. The fire of unbelievable hardships, ridicule, gossip, financial problems. He is going to shake everything that can be shaken! He is going to shake, and scrub, and burn, and purge - and purify!\r\n\r\nNo man or woman of God will escape the purging! God is determined to get all the dross and filth out of us. The purge will spread from the pulpit to the pew! Get ready, saints! God is getting ready to expose all sin, all adultery, all foolishness! The Holy Ghost is going to reprove us of sin. How can you play games when God puts you in His crucible and turns up the fire? Your Holy Ghost baptism is going to have some fire put to it now!\r\n\r\nMalachi said - <strong>“…the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven: and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up…” (</strong><a href=\"http://bible.logos.com/passage/kjv/Malachi%204.1\"><strong>Malachi 4:1 KJV</strong></a><strong>)</strong>\r\n\r\nGod also promises to bring down the strongholds of the enemy! He is going to once and for all let the devil and the world know who has the power!\r\n\r\nIf God is about to do all that the prophets predicted He would - WHAT A GLORIOUS FUTURE JUST AHEAD!\r\n\r\nA purged, purified ministry!\r\n\r\nA Church that God is calling back to repentance and holiness.\r\n\r\nA people washed, cleansed - offering praises in true righteousness.\r\n\r\nA revival among our young people! Drug strongholds coming down! Alcohol and divorce no longer prevalent among God’s people.\r\n\r\nThe sound of prayer - intercession!\r\n\r\nA people of God who will discern between the holy and the unholy!\r\n\r\nEverywhere, God’s people turning again to the Word.\r\n\r\nA tested, tried people, once again devoted to the Person of Jesus Christ!\r\n\r\nHis Person being lifted up to draw all men to Him!\r\n\r\nChrist no longer the stranger in our midst, but CROWNED - PRE-EMINENT!\r\n\r\nA Pentecost that truly exalts the name and power of Jesus Christ, the Lord of all.

              "<strong>Daniel 5:26-27, “26This is the interpretation of the matter: Mene, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; 27Tekel, you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting; Peres, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians”</strong>\n\nThe Apostle Paul wrote to Timothy, \"<strong><em>Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching (2 Tim 4:2)</em></strong>.\" Ray Comfort says there are only two times to preach the Word of God, in season and out of season! That constitutes all times. In the book of Daniel, The prophet Daniel was summoned because the king, Belshazzar, was told by the queen that \"<strong><em>There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods (5:11)</em></strong>.\" Daniel means “God is my judge,” but was changed to Belteshazzar, or “Bel protect the king. This king, whose name (similar to Daniel’s, cf. 4:8) means “Bel, protect the king,” is about to be conquered by the Medo-Persian army, and is warned as such in the midst of a feast that he threw at his palace. It was in the midst of this feast that Daniel was called upon to preach the Word of God.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe King had desecrated the stolen articles from the temple of God, he was a thief. He committed adultery and polygamy with the many wives and concubines, and made an idol out of the stolen vessels, worshipping the created things rather than the creator. In the midst of a prideful king that was most likely feeling like the mist powerful and untouchable man in the world God comes and awakens him, not with a nice little message that he can live his best life now, he was already doing that!\n\nStealing articles from the temple would have been attractive booty not only because they were made of precious metals, but because they had been dedicated to the God Yahweh for use in the rituals of the temple. Power was demonstrated over the deity by taking those things that were most significant to him. <strong>Daniel 5:4</strong> reads, \"<strong><em>They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone</em></strong>.\" Similar to Aaron making a golden calf in the desert and calling it Yahweh, the Babylonians worshipped the false gods aforementioned and would have believed them to be more powerful than the god they stole them from, which in this case was the true and living God. This helps set the backdrop for what takes place in light of the invisible hand writing on the wall. At the height of their celebration, and in addition making a mockery of the God of the Temple from which the vessels were stolen God would not allow His name to be blasphemed by these pagans. Rather, he confronted the king as \"<em>Babylonian hands had taken God’s vessels (mentioned twice) and held them in contempt to dishonor and challenge Him. Now the hand that controls all men, and which none can restrain, challenged them (4:35). God’s answer to their challenge was clear, as in vv. 23–28</em> (MacArthur Study Bible).\".\n\nBel, a Babylonian deity (god), would not and could not protect the king from any of what was taking place. God wrote on the kings wall, \"Immediately the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace, opposite the lampstand.\"\n\n<strong>Illumination</strong>.\nThe lamp stand which was created for the purpose of illumine the furniture in the tabernacle and represented the light that God was to his people in the darkened world of sin (Ps. 27:3).burned day and night, symbolizing the sacred presence of God (MacArthur study Bible). <em>\"While in Solomon's Temple light and golden reflection magnified the sense of splendor and glory inherent in Solomon’s temple and God’s presence (IVP Old Testament Bible Backgrounds Commentary).\"</em> Now God placed His Word in such a place on the plaster of the walls, so the lamp stand once again would symbolize the presence of God. \"The king saw as the hand it wrote.\" To Continue, Blessings Past Phil"

              "<strong>Daniel 5:26-27, “26This is the interpretation of the matter: Mene, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; 27Tekel, you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting; Peres, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>The pride of an empire before a fall</strong>. Recall the prideful puffed out chest of the land of Egypt during the time of the exodus. God would reign down his judgments on this idolatrous land. What causes the demise or end of an empire. What brings about something as great and magnificent, as wealthy and as far reaching, as militarily mighty as the Babylonian Empire to fall? This is a crucial question to ask, God stands sovereign over nations. I think of the United States with its idolatry, celebrating ungodly lifestyles and calling it diversity, murdering children in its \"<strong><em>abortuaries</em></strong>\" and calling it choice, a place of wealth and military power, and raising up heretical preachers (false prophets) which simply \"Christianize\" the American dream. It looks like there are many comparisons between the heart of Babylon and the heart of America. Will God bring this nation to its knees (like a repentant Nineveh) or to its destruction like fallen prideful Babylon?<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>The Fear of the Lord</strong>. The previous king had lost his very reason for seven years and then came out of that and praised the God of Daniel. Yet not this king, he did not learn from the legacy of his grandfather. It would seem similar to God's imminent judgment on the Egyptians when he showered down 10 plagues which made a mockery of their false gods, as the Babylonians praised their false gods, the true God would show Himself strong and triumphant over the false gods, as His \"hand\" wrote on the wall. The king feared what the true King (unbeknown to himself) had written. Daniel 5:6 tells of the fear that plagued the king, \"<strong><em>Then the king’s color changed, and his thoughts alarmed him; his limbs gave way, and his knees knocked together</em></strong>...\". The music had stopped, the praise has ceased, the dancing abated, the drinking halted, and the presence of another had rattled all, especially the king. I recall when I got bullied in school by a bunch of guys over about a two week time span, things didn't stop until I stood up to the head of the group. Pinning the head honcho up against the lockers and screaming at him in front of the whole group and everyone else that was in the hallway, struck fear, and embarrassment into his heart, causing the bullying to cease that day forward. The Lord struck his fear into the heart of the king, the one everyone looked to as the source of power and authority that had the \"gods\" on his side, with an invisible hand writing with divine graffiti on the wall of the king and his kingdom. His color changed, he probably became \"white as a ghost\" to borrow form the expression, his thoughts alarmed him, his mind plagued this unknown phenomenon. I imagine with his thoughts came a racing heartbeat, and sweat, as the troubled mind plagued by fear has a powerful reaction on the body. His limbs became weak and knees knocked together. In other words the outward manifestation of the body, reflected what was going on within the mind of the king! Imagine what everyone felt as they looked at the king that was threatened by the real unbeknown King. In his fearful, confused and flabbergasted state he doesn't know what to make of this not what to do. He does not have a response to this in and of himself, so what does he do, he calls for help. Verse 7 states, \"<strong><em>The king called loudly to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers</em></strong>.\". Why does he call these men? Like Nebuchadnezzar, when the king had a dream, vision, or supernatural manifestation take place he would summon those that were considered to be able to interpret such things. This is the beginnings of the group known as the Magi, which would someday years later journey to an obscure place called Bethlehem to present a newborn king with precious gifts. You see, the magi served the king, and this is where this all comes together with the fearful king. One of these magi he called was none other than Daniel, the Hebrew forced in exile when the Babylonians ransacked Jerusalem as he was taken captive. At first when the king summons his magi, Daniel is not found to be among them (and he never is), and when he questions them to read the writing or make known to the king the interpretation, but to no avail. Daniel had his name changed, given a Babylonian education, heard their music, and everything concerning Daniel outwardly was changed, however his identity as a servant of God could not, and would be altered. He was a man of NO COMPROMISE! It was this committed resolve that caused Daniel to stand out from the cream of the crop among the magi. \"<strong><em>Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed, and his color changed, and his lords were perplexed.</em></strong>\". The fear burrows deeper in his mind, as he finds not even the magi can interpret not respond to this fearful occurrence. He sees himself as a man all out of options, to this unanswerable, fearful thing that is happening to him. The lords, his guest were made up of nobles and magistrates, as well are perplexed (to be terrified, become anxious), they don't know what to make of it. Their hearts are likely racing as well. God put the king on \"front street\" and struck fear into his heart, and hence the hearts of all the lords with him as they witnessed his reaction! <strong><em>Hence God wished to summon this impious king to His tribunal when the hand of a man appeared before him in the act of writing </em></strong>(Commentary on the book of the prophet Daniel). No one knows what to do, all are fearful, confused, disoriented, but a glimmer of hope comes when the queen, or better said, the queen mother ...."

              "<strong>Daniel 5:26-27, “26This is the interpretation of the matter: Mene, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end; 27Tekel, you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting; Peres, your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Proclamation of what was written</strong>. Daniel who had the spirit of God within, was the only one known to be able to interpret this \"strange message\", foreign to the Babylonians, but not to the prophet Daniel. The Apostle Paul reminds us, \"... <strong><em>the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be</em></strong>.\" This king could not understand the Word of God, but Daniel was a diligent able to rightly divide the word of truth. Daniel was always ready to preach the Word of God in season and about of season. He would preach the truth no matter the circumstances, later in in Daniel, the well-known lion’s Den episode would display how he would not forsake his regular and active prayer life, even though it was more than politically incorrect, it was against the law of the land. This is the type of follower of God that he was. Where are the Daniel's of today?<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Judgment</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of God came upon the king. \"<strong><em>That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was killed</em></strong>. And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old. God sets up and puts down whosoever He decides. John MacArthur shares, \"<em>The Babylonian Empire was once the glorious head of gold. The crown of the times of the gentiles. But it had gradually deteriorated. It had gradually entered a state of debauchery, a state of degeneration. Until the hour of its doom is finally pronounced suddenly and totally and the Medo-Persian army sweeps in. And it is the end of a great and historic era</em>.\" The Potter has freedom to do whatsoever He wills with His creation. Listen tender hearted to the Psalmist words, \"2 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?\r\n\r\n2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying,\r\n3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.\r\n4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.\r\n5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.\r\n6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.\r\n7 I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\r\n8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\r\n9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.\r\n10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.\r\n11 Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.\r\n12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.\r\n\r\nThis is what happened with King <strong><em>Belshazzar</em></strong>, he was judged by a higher King, the King of Kings who ultimately numbered the days of <strong><em>Belshazzar</em></strong>. This was the end of the kingdom of Babylon rule prophesied by Daniel (Daniel 2) as the Head of Gold described which ruled from 605-539 B.C. and followed by the Breast of Silver which was Medo-Persia rule from 539 - 331 B.C.. However, God will ultimately destroy all the Kingdoms of this world as the rock of Christ at His second coming establishes the King of Kings and His Kingdom upon the earth! The kingdom's of this world have as much hope in their kingdom as an ant against a nuclear warhead headed straight for it. There is only hope in Christ and submitting to His Kingdom, and being found serving the true King in the only Kingdom that will last, for all eternity. MacArthur again shares concerning Daniel 5, \"<em>The first scene in the chapter is an orgy. It is filled with desecration, blasphemy, evil acts. The history would describe for us, but I would not assault your brain with such a description. In the midst of the orgy is the awesome intervention of God who pronounces doom on the whole empire. And in a few hours, that doom comes. And I believe that all civilization follows the very </em><strong><em>same pattern</em></strong><em>. </em><strong><em>It rises to its heights</em></strong><em>. At its height, it is </em><strong><em>filled with pride</em></strong><em>. In the midst of its pride, and </em><strong><em>self-indulgence, and materialism it begins to descend into degeneration, and debauchery, and evil</em></strong><em>. And as it descends, </em><strong><em>it comes closer and closer to its destruction</em></strong>.\" This looks a lot like America, and perhaps some other countries in our world. God is being very patient, but His patience will not last forever. Nations must submit to the Lord, to the Kingdom of God because they have No Hope against Him.\r\n\r\nThis begs the question, are you are part of the Kingdom of God, or the Kingdom of this world? Whose kingdom are you serving? If it is not God's Kingdom, there is no hope for you. Repent of your sin, and put your trust in Christ and His righteousness. Psalm 2 read, \"<strong><em>Kiss the Son, les</em></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>t he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him</em></strong>.\" Bow your knee to the Son, Jesus Christ, for \"<strong><em>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God</em></strong> (Hebrew 10:31).\" The fear of the Lord is the begging of wisdom, will you humble yourself and bow the knee to the true King?\r\n\r\n<strong><em>A picture of Daniel's Prophecy</em></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/images/daniel-2-image.jpg\">http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/images/daniel-2-image.jpg</a></em>\r\n\r\nI found this illustration, and even though the statement written above the picture is not in the Bible, it is a poignant question. America must heed the reality of Dan 5 in God's dealings with Babylon, and repent, for the Bible shows how God sheds His grace on whosoever He wills. God's grace may not always strive with USA, as it daily puffs it chests of pride out to Him. In one word America, straying with these that profess Christ, must repent!\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...\r\n\r\nBlessings,\r\nPhil,\r\n\r\nEvangelist, Soulfishing Ministries &lt;&gt;&lt;"

              "<strong>Galatians 3:6-9 , “6 just as Abraham “believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” 7 Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, “In you all the nations shall be blessed.”</span> 9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6147\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"215\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThe blessing of Abraham is many times looked at as material blessings since God had blessed him with wealth, however Paul points out that the blessing of Abraham is in reference to salvation by faith apart from works. Vs. 7,\"<strong>Therefore know that only those who are of faith are sons of Abraham”</strong>\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">The Judaizers in Galatia were perverting the gospel by adding other elements to a company salvation. Two things they hammered, circumcision and keeping of the law. Circumcision was part of initiating them into Judaism as candidates for salvation and then they had to keep the law to be saved. They considered themselves the children of Abraham and they claimed Abraham accomplished both.</span>\r\n\r\nTwo instances from history would disqualify this reasoning. 1. Abraham was circumcised 14 years later after he was justified by faith. 2. The law came with Moses 430 years after Abraham was long gone. Here Paul explains in vs. 8, how salvation of Abraham came about, \"<strong>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, ... \" </strong>The Scripture, the Word, Christ Himself preached the gospel to Abraham by giving him a promise and Abraham believed God and that was counted to him for righteousness. This proves that, \"<strong>the just shall live on the principle of faith alone.\"\r\n</strong>\r\nA classic example of Abraham's blessing comes from the New Testament, the salvation of Zacchaeus, <strong>Luke 19:9-10, \"And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham; for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.</strong>” His salvation was justification by faith alone apart from works. God had promised Abraham that those who come through the same door of faith as he did would be considered his sons something Zacchaeus had been declared. <strong>Galatians 3:9, “So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>“This among others are blessings in Christ, and not temporal, but spiritual ones, even all spiritual blessings; as redemption, reconciliation, peace, pardon, adoption, sanctification, and eternal life, and particularly justification; this is the blessedness more especially intended, which comes not upon the circumcision only, but the uncircumcision also; and they that partake of this are blessed indeed; for they are justified from all sin, are free from condemnation”</em>, John Gill\r\n<em>\r\n\"Men fast, pray, watch, suffer, they intend to appease the wrath of God and to deserve God's grace by their exertions. But there is no glory in it for God, because by their exertions these workers pronounce God an unmerciful slave driver, an unfaithful and angry Judge. They despise God, make a liar out of Him, snub Christ and all His benefits; in short they pull God from His throne and perch themselves on it. They enthrone themselves and dethrone God from His throne\"</em>\r\n\r\n<em>\"Without faith God forfeits His glory, wisdom, truth, and mercy in us. The first duty of man is to believe in God and to honor Him with his faith. Faith is truly the height of wisdom, the right kind of righteousness, the only real religion\", </em>Martin Luther\r\n\r\n<strong>Faith truly honors God. And because faith honors God, God counts faith for righteousness</strong>. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 14:22-34, “29 So He said, “Come.” And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. 30 But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-6100\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"image\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nTo be used of God is solely to rely on His great power to accomplish His purpose. Our faith and testimony of God’s capability of accomplishing things through vessels He has chosen are seen in these times. Often times believers forget that <strong>“… we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us”, 2Corinthians 4:7.</strong>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->In <b>Matthew 14,</b> Peter saw his Master walk on water so he asked Him to command him to come to Him on water. And the Lord said come. Vs. <strong>“29 … And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus”. </strong>The miracle here was solely to direct him to Jesus with his eyes fixed on Him and Him alone.\r\n\r\nSomething then happened, vs. “<strong>30 But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out”. </strong>Before he stepped out of the boat he knew the wind was boisterous, however he stepped out by faith and kept his eyes on His Lord. Though not recorded, in the midst of doing the impossible, <strong>perhaps he took his focus off Christ and became consumed with the supernatural (miracle)</strong>. For a minute he may have been preoccupied by the miracle which led him to drift. Time would prove the miracle was for a different purpose. Peter walked on water being supported, enabled and held up by the power of Christ.\r\n\r\nIf we become preoccupied with miracles (blessings the Lord bring our way), we like Peter are bound to sink with time. I have seen ministers who started so well, God mightily used them, however with time, they took their focus off of Christ and became wowed by the miracles performed which robbed Christ what was rightfully His because, “…<strong>the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us”, 2Corinthians 4:7.</strong> The miracle is what consumed them, that is what they wanted to happen in their lives. That is what they chased, a power for their agendas. That is the means they used to build their ministries, miracles becoming a means to exploit people for money. <strong>Jesus is the giver and the object of our faith</strong>. The moment you take your focus off the object of our faith, that will be the beginning of your sinking and we have seen it many times.\r\n\r\nI love that even in the midst of his drift, Peter realized his state and cried to the Lord to save him. He turned his focus back on Him who had made him do the impossible. Vs. <strong>30 But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”. </strong>This ought to be our cry every time we drift. We are at war with ourselves everyday, we must keep ourselves in check so as not to lose our focus. <strong>Hebrews 2:1-4, “1 Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away. 2 For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just reward, 3 how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard Him, 4 God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?\" Blessings Ev</strong>"

              "<strong>Proverbs 23:7, \"As he thinks in his heart so is he...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nNothing begins to tailors our lives life like how we think of ourselves. You will agree with me that how you perceive yourself has a way of affecting your life. I would say that what we think of about ourselves in Christ matters a lot. If you continue to see yourself defeated, sooner or later you begin develop those symptoms. What comes out your mouth is a reflection of what you have inside. Speaking defeat indicates you are harboring defeat inside. This boils down to, whose report will you believe? Either you are going to be like Joshua and Caleb who brought good report or the other 10 spies the bible does not even waste time giving us their names who brought a different report, report of defeat.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWhat comes out of your mouth can be build or tear, can sweeten or poison. The Shunamite woman saw her dead situation, however faith inside drove her to believe God. Because of what she believed, she pushed it out of her mouth with such great confession of faith, \"<strong>All is well with my soul</strong>\". We also see the woman with the issue of blood knowing her condition still sought for healing which propelled her to push out of her faith, she said \"<strong>If I may but touch the hem of his garment, I know will be made whole</strong>\". <strong>Two common things with these women, they both had evident problems but they did not allow them to define how they felt about themselves in the situation</strong>. They understood the concept of as \"<strong>you think in your heart so are you\"</strong> and therefore they refused to give in to defeat. I am not saying ignore and deny reality, I am saying <strong>see the reality as a means by which God will do something and make a stand on God’s promises by faith</strong>.\r\n\r\nA part from what we think of ourselves, we have to be very careful about what we speak into others especially our kids. Parents, <strong>Proverbs 22:6, says \"Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it</strong>\". You call your child dumb, stupid, worthless, he will grow seeing himself that way. Parents ought to invest in their kids that regardless of what other people see and say to them, you have greater faith in God for them so you invest in them. You have the passion, the zeal to bring them up in the way God desires of you. Kids learn mostly from what they observe, and who better observe than you? Who better lay a foundation but you?\r\n\r\nA husband abusing his wife exposes his kids and sends a message that it’s ok to abuse a spouse, that may open a door for a repetition one day. If they come from abusive physically and verbally home, they may likely do the same. Parents have to set an example by their life style and what comes out of their mouths. I fail to understand why many parents are frustrated with their kids when they sowed wrong seeds in them, <strong>Galatians 6:7, \"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap</strong>\". You are the role model for your kids.\r\n\r\nParents instead of worrying about what your kids will turn out to be when you turn them loose, plant seeds of prayers, intercede for them. Lay your hands on them, speak life into them and let them know that you are there for them. Encourage them, build confidence in them to trust God<strong>. A strong foundation laid will not be shaken by what others may say contrary to what you have invested in them</strong>. Provide discipline as a sign of love, lead them to church a place of growth and be the one who they look up to. Most kids feel their dads are the most valuable people, strong; one they want to be like when they grow up, do not take that away from them by the wrong things you do and speak over them. How do you think of yourself, what are your confessions to show what is inside of you? how does what you do or say affect the younger generation? Blessings Evans"

              "In <strong>2Chronicles 6,</strong> Solomon began to lead the children of Israel in prayer. He would seek the Lord's help in many areas that affected the people. 1) crime (vv. 22, 23); 2) enemy attacks (vv. 24, 25); 3) drought (vv. 26, 27); 4) famine (vv. 28–31); 5) foreigners (vv. 32, 33); 6) war (vv. 34, 35); and 7) sin (vv. 36–39). But there is one reoccurring phrase that appears, and that phrase is \"THEN HEAR FROM HEAVEN.\" When you and I pray in corporate settings such as Solomon did, do you lift your voice more to be heard by others or by the Lord? Let me say, it is not necessarily a bad thing if others are hearing you, and are encouraged by your prayer as long as you are not praying to make a showcase for this is not the purpose of prayer meetings. Many prayer meetings are more like town hall gossip sessions, where there is more talking to one another than to God. Jonathan Edwards preached a sermon titled <em>The Most High God A Prayer - Hearing God </em>in 1736. In it he spoke about the fact that it was God that instituted prayer and that the institution of prayer is not because God is ignorant of our wants or desires. <strong><em>\"Rather prayer furthers the glorification of God, the goal of all creation. Prayer is but a sensible acknowledgment of our dependence on Him to His glory.\"<!--more--></em></strong>\r\n\r\nIt is in light of this, going back to Solomon's prayer on behalf of his people that it would seem that the phrase, \"THEN HEAR FROM HEAVEN”, is spoken by Solomon repeatedly. I counted eight times in Solomon's prayer that he echoed the aforementioned phrase. It does not matter if others hear you when you pray, it ultimately matters if heaven is hearing you. You may pray in a football stadium using top notch sound equipment, but if heaven is not hearing you, what does it matter if you mutter that most articulate prayer even prayed? Prayer is missing from many of our homes, churches, schools, etc.... Many say prayers, but few pray prayers. What do I mean? I'm glad you are wondering. Many say the Lord’s prayer, which is rode aptly called the disciples prayer, because the Lord's Prayer is found in <strong>John 17,</strong> and because someone repeats the words, they believe that they prayed. However, saying the words, doesn't mean you are praying, because this is an outline to help us know how to pray not what to say. Prayer begins with God not man. Here are three different lens' to look through as adapted from John MacArthur’s sermon on the disciples prayer.\r\n\r\nLens 1: the RELATIONSHIP that we have with God, it's relationally complete and amazing!\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Our Father,\" Father-child relationship with God. - Abba Father</li>\r\n\t<li>\"Hallowed be thy name,\" we have a deity and worshiper relationship with God. - His Holy Name</li>\r\n\t<li>\"Thy kingdom come.\" We have a sovereign and a subject relationship with God. - seek His Kingdom</li>\r\n\t<li>\"Thy will be done,\" we have a Master and a servant relationship with God. - Garden of Gethsemane prayer</li>\r\n\t<li>\"Give us our daily bread.\" We have a benefactor and a beneficiary relationship with God.</li>\r\n\t<li>\"forgive us our (trespasses or our) debts,\" we have a Savior sinner relationship with God. - Repentance</li>\r\n\t<li>\"Lead us not into temptation,\" we have a guide and a pilgrim relationship with God.- Strength to stand and flee</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLens 2: What is to be our attitude as we pray? <strong>Philippians 2:5</strong> \"Let this mind/attitude be Christ like in you\"\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Our,\" that's an unselfish spirit,</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Father,\" that's a family spirit,</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Hallowed be thy name.\" A reverent spirit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Thy kingdom come.\" A loyal spirit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Thy will be done,\" a submissive spirit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Give us our daily bread.\" A dependent spirit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Forgive us our trespasses,\" a penitent spirit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Lead us not into temptation,\" a humble spirit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Thine is the kingdom,\" a confident spirit,</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"and the power,\" a triumphant spirit,</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"and the glory,\" an exultant spirit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLens 3: 3 Elements- the first three God's glory, the second three man's need.\r\n\r\nThe first three the glory of God,\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Hallowed be thy name.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>That's the glory of God.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe second three man's need,\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Give us our daily bread.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Forgive us our debts,</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>and lead us not into temptation.\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDo you see the point is this first when you pray you set God in His rightful place, do you see it? Then everything else flows out of it. All prayer is to begin with the character of God, <strong>\"Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done.</strong>\" And then what follows? God is in His supreme place, and when God is first prayer makes sense.\r\n\r\nRecall when Christ was being baptized, the God of heaven responded and spoke and a voice came from heaven, “<strong>You are my beloved Son;3 with you I am well pleased</strong>.”4 , as did God speak during the transfiguration of Christ as well. saying, \"<strong>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One listen to him</strong>! Heaven heard the life, prayers, and ministry of Christ.\r\n\r\nBeing in ministry, I have watched many of the trends in Christianity from types of music, particular songs, the latest book everyone is reading, church growth tactics, etc.... However, having a relationship with Christ by His Word and in prayer are what cultivates such a relationship. Christ communicates with those that are His, He said, \"<strong>My sheep hear my voice (John 10)\".</strong> Are you hearing from heaven with your prayers, life, and ministry? If you are hearing from Heaven then God will illuminate His Word to you (<strong>Luke 24).</strong> Many people want to hear from God, they just don’t want take the time to open His Word. That is like wanting to be an Olympic swimming champion but not wanting to get wet! Much of Christianity today is more focused on emotionalism, rather than Christ; feelings instead of the Savior, vision and dreams in place of the Word of God. Trends will continue, but God remains the same, and commands us, \"58 <strong><em>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain</em></strong>.\"\r\n\r\nPray to heaven, hear from heaven (read the Scriptures), and obey heaven (obey the Word of God).\r\n\r\nUntil the nets are filled...\r\n\r\nPhil, the evangelist"

              "<strong>Matthew 2:1-12, “1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, 2 saying, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">HIS STAR</span> in the East and have come to worship Him.”</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are many things in the history of the bible when looked at carefully are foreshadows of greater things to come. They all point to Jesus and to make Him more brighter than they all.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, Christ is born in the days of Herod the king. A king had been born in the midst of another king threatening the existing king. In the midst of all these, the bible also brings to light the wise men from the east. \"<em>These were perhaps the first fruits of the Gentiles. Probably they were Gentile philosophers, who, through the Divine assistance, had improved their knowledge of nature, as a means of leading to the knowledge of the one true God. It is not unreasonable to suppose that God had favored them with some extraordinary revelation of Himself, as he did Melchisedec, Job, and several others, who were not of the family of Abraham\"</em>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe see that these wise men came to Jerusalem for one purpose to find He who was born king and worship Him. And the only way they could find Him was to be led by not just any star but by <strong>HIS STAR </strong>as recorded. Four things happened in the presence of the star 1<strong>. They saw the star and realized it was telling them something about a king, 2. They followed the star to find out more, 3. They were then led by the star to where they needed to be (vs. 9, “…the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came and stood over where the young Child was”) and, 4.They rejoiced in seeing the star,(vs. 10. “When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy”)</strong>\r\n\r\nIs the star here not a foreshadow of the promise of the Father? I think in our time many of what we call the work of the Holy Spirit is off focus. Many equate His work as to giving people feelings, ecstasy, emotions, falling down etc. Here is a picture of HIS STAR, the Holy Spirit who reveals to us Himself, then draws us to Himself then leads us to the King of kings to worship Him. <strong>In this we rejoice in the Holy Spirit, we even praise Him primarily not because He has revealed Himself but rather, He has led us to the One who deserves the glory.</strong> Here is what Jesus said primarily of the work of the Holy Spirit, <strong>John 16:13-15, “ However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. 14 <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.</span> 15 All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you”</strong>.\r\n\r\n“<em>There seems to be a great danger of losing sight of the fact that Jesus was ‘all in all.’ The work of Calvary, the atonement, must be the center for our consideration. The Holy Ghost will never draw our attention from Christ to Himself, but rather reveal Christ in a fuller way. We are in danger of slighting Jesus - getting Him ‘lost in the temple,’ by the exaltation of the Holy Ghost and of the gifts of the Spirit. Jesus must be the center of everything.”</em>, David Wilkerson.<strong> Colossians 1:18-19, “And He is the head of the body, the Church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things He might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in Him should all fullness dwell… ” (KJV). “</strong><em>Any work that exalts the Holy Ghost or ‘gifts’ above Jesus will finally end up in fanaticism. Whatever causes us to exalt and love Jesus is well and safe. The reverse will ruin all. </em><strong><em>The Holy Ghost is a <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">great light</span>, but focused on Jesus always for His revealing</em></strong><em>. “Where the Holy Ghost is actually in control, Jesus is proclaimed the Head - the Holy Ghost, His executive.” </em>David Wilkerson\r\n\r\nThe wise men did not see the star and begin to pay great attention to it even though its presence was very important and must be acknowledged. Perhaps back in the day they could have been excited to see such a unique star, however something about this star was different. The star was on a mission and so is the Holy Spirit is on a mission to glorify Christ.\r\n\r\nIf what is operating in you is not revealing Christ in a fuller sense through the word, prayers, leading you to worship Him as He ought to be worshipped, not revealing to you who you really are and who He really is, or letting you glorify him above Christ, I wonder if His Star, the Holy Spirit is at work in your life. Don’t lose focus of His presence and purpose.

              "<strong>2Corinthians 10:3-5, “3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. 4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">mighty in God</span> for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ”\r\n</strong>\r\nWhen we hear of spiritual warfare, we immediately think of battling spiritual demonic forces attacking our health, our finances, our families etc. In studying this verse, the spiritual warfare is much much greater than that. If anything, it’s the battle to stay steadfast on what God has revealed in His word and refute those who contradict it.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI know not of what is battled in our day like the battle to dethrone Christ that man might be exalted. The battle believers engage in is to keep the word pure, unadulterated, unhindered both in our lives and around us ...“<strong>14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, 15 but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ</strong>”, <strong>Ephesians 4:14-15.</strong>\r\n\r\nThis battle began in the garden of Eden where Satan challenged men to doubt God’s word. This was the first defiant of the word of God where men indirectly said, “<em>not Your will but mine be done</em>”, right into the New Testament in the wilderness where Christ was also challenged to go against the Word. We also see men like Paul though walking in the flesh were not battling according to the flesh, they battled to keep the word pure by preaching the true gospel of God to battle against the lies which were being spewed in their day. The battle continues today where men attack the bible, even hijack the bible and make it say what they want it to say even by some who call themselves shepherds of the flock. <strong>If we doubt the credibility of the Word, its authority and its sufficiency, we have lost the battle</strong>.\r\n\r\n“<em>The work of the ministry is a spiritual warfare with spiritual enemies, and for spiritual purposes. Outward force is not the method of the gospel, but strong persuasions, by the power of truth and the meekness of wisdom. Thus the weapons of our warfare are very powerful; the evidence of truth is convincing. What opposition is made against the gospel, by the powers of sin and Satan in the hearts of men! But observe the conquest the word of God gains. The appointed means, however feeble they appear to some, will be mighty through God. And the preaching of the cross, by men of faith and prayer, has always been fatal to idolatry, impiety, and wickedness</em>”, Matthew Henry\r\n\r\nSome examples, Men like Apollos had mighty weapons in God and they pulled down strongholds, casting down arguments and everything that tried to stand and exalt themselves against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ. Apollos <strong>“…vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ”,</strong> <strong>Acts 18:28</strong>. Paul in speaking with Felix the governor<strong>, Acts 24:25, “Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid...”.</strong> Paul in preparing his son in the faith Timothy gave him this weapon, <strong>1Timothy 4:16, “ Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you”</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>“The \"weapons\" with which this warfare is managed are the Scriptures of truth, the sword of the Spirit, the word of God; and which indeed are an armory, out of which may be taken weapons of all sorts, both offensive and defensive; such as serve both to establish and secure the doctrines of the Gospel, and to refute the errors of the wicked: to which may be added all those gifts which Christ has received for, and gives to men, qualifying them for the work of the ministry, ... but mighty through God: powerful and effectual through the blessing of God, and the influences of his grace and Spirit for the conversion of sinners, the edification of saints, the defense of truth, the confutation of error, the destruction of Satan's kingdom, and the enlargement of Christ's: for these weapons are not powerful of themselves; they are passive instruments, which are only efficacious when used by a superior hand; when the Gospel ministration is attended with \"the demonstration of the Spirit, and of power\"; and then they are serviceable”</em>, John Gill\r\n\r\nIt was Charles Spurgeon who was asked to do something when the bible, the Word of God was under attack, his response, “<em>you don’t need to defend a lion, just turn it loose and it will defend itself”</em> That is what we must do in the times we are living in. Our weapons of warfare, the word and prayer are not carnal (fleshly), they are mighty in God for pulling down everything that tries to elevate themselves against the knowledge of God, we need to turn this lion loose.\r\n\r\nThe bible <strong>James 4:7, “Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you”.</strong> In other words, submit to God in prayer and the word and you have the tools NOT for casting out the devil but tools to RESIST him because they are mighty in God. This what Jesus did in the wilderness and this is what we must do. Everyday the battle to doubt, manipulate, change the word of God is presented to us, we must submit to God and then have the ability to resist.

              "<strong>Psalm 42:1-6, \"As the deer pants for the water brooks, So pants my soul for You, O God\"</strong>\r\n\r\nOne can only move because there is a reason for the move. The psalmist gives us a picture of what his hunger and thirst is like. I don't know much about the deer's but I believe that when they are thirsty for water, they run to find a place to drink water and they stick there until they are filled. Anyone who is not thirsty will not run around looking for water and anyone who is not hungry will also not run around looking for food. Praise be to God that we are in a place where our souls can pant after God because we haven't had enough of Him.<!--more--> The Samaritan woman kept on going to the well to get the water that could only quench her thirst for a season but when Jesus appeared and talked to her about the eternal water, she began to pant for it, <strong>John 4:15, \"The woman said unto Him, \"Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not\". The bible also says in Mathew 5:6, \"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled</strong>\". We need to hunger and thirst again for God and the things above. The bible says in <strong>Romans 14:17, \"The kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost\". </strong>We are not panting after the material or the natural things, we are panting after righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. We are calling on God of heaven to send His kingdom down we hunger for, the King and His kingdom\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 42:2, \"My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?\". </strong>There is a person who thirst so much for God that he can't wait to be in his presence. When the Samaritan woman was thirsty, she tried to satisfy her thirst with men in her life, tried different things. In our age, people try to satisfy their thirst with drugs, sex, drowning themselves in work, getting more of materials. Funny thing, they do temporarily. The Samaritan woman was offered the best water to fill her thirst and we too have been offered the same. I know that at times I drag to find the Lord and at times I'm not thirsty enough to really pant more to find Him. My desire and prayers is that my soul shall thirst for the living God, always desiring an opportunity to appear before Him. I cannot be satisfied with anything if He does not fill me.\r\n\r\nOne thing I like about the psalmist is the fact that he can tell he is not where he is supposed to be. He knows by what he remembers. <strong>Psalm 42:4, \"When I remember these things, I pour out my soul within me. For I used to go with the multitude: I went with them to the house of God, With the voice of joy and praise...\"</strong>. A place of remembrance often tips you if you are progressing or not, drifting back or not. In his remembrance, he realized he lost the hunger and thirst he had and desired it back. We like the psalmist need to be brought to a place of remembrance where we see that we are not hungry for the word like we used to, not thirsty for prayer like we used to, not thirsty for the Holy Ghost conviction like we used. We become lukewarm when we are supposed to be hot. We become satisfied with the little we have when He so has much more to give.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 42:5, \"Why are you cast down, O my soul? And why are you disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him for the help of His countenance\". </strong>As you go through spiritual dryness, it's easy to begin to feel down. Feeling like you have messed up big time and there is no way you can rise to the level you were once before. I would pray like the psalmist and speak and ask my soul this question, \"<em>Why are you cast down?, you can’t' cry over what you lost, it's not over until God says it's over, rise up and put your hope in God\".</em> God can only fill us if we are ready for to be filled. The psalmist looked at his situation and saw where he gave up and how his soul went into despair but he refused to stay in that condition. If you and I are going to thirst, it's time to awaken the soul and speak hope into it by yet praising Him for the help of his countenance (<strong>Appearance of His face</strong>).\r\n\r\nHunger and thirst will change the way you think, your actions and the direction you take. Regardless of what you are into or have been to, you have a reason to thirst for more of Him again to be filled of Him. That part of you that has gone cold and content needs to be wakened that we rise and to go down to his well, river, stream for filling. I want more so I thirst for more that He may fill me to over flow. <strong>Psalm 81:10,”I am the LORD your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt; Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it”. </strong>Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Deuteronomy 10:12-13, “And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all His ways, to love Him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to observe the Lord's commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Step #1 Precepts</strong> - The rules, regulations, codes, and requirements of Scripture. “You shall not murder” He gave specific commandments like a parent telling their child not to touch a hot stove. <strong>Galatians 3:24</strong> states, <strong>24 So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith</strong>.”<!--more--> In the Greek speaking world of Paul’s day there was a role played by one of the household servants called the <em>paidagogos</em>. He was responsible for the moral welfare and character development of a child. One of his responsibilities was to take the child to school every day, and make sure that the child was brought under the authority and care of the teacher. Paul borrows from the culture of his day to show us that the law has the same function. The commands of Scripture are not only designed to say “Do this,” and “Don’t do that,” but to lead us beyond the precept to a universal principle (one that applies to everyone) and ultimately to the God who expresses Himself through precept.\r\n\r\n<strong>Step #2 Principles</strong> - If precepts are the first step toward knowing God, and distinguishing right from wrong, principles are the vehicle or stairway from leading us from precepts to the person of God. Behind each command (precept) is a principle. Principle is the why behind a command. Most Christians don’t know why they believe what they believe. A concern for safety is one of the principles for a mother’s command for her child to look before crossing the street so as not to end up as road kill. In the events from 9/11, many saw more a reverence for life, a principle behind the command “You shall not kill.”\r\n\r\n<strong>Step #3 - Person (of God). </strong>To know what we believe about God’s precepts and even the principles behind those precepts from whom they derive is worthless without the relationship. Too many times when we focus on the law of God, we miss seeing its extensions - which it teaches us about the character, nature and person of God. God is a person.\r\n\r\nMoses when receiving the law on top of Mt. Sinai apparently understood this progression of precept-principle-person of God. <strong>Exodus 33:11</strong> states that God spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend, Moses prayed, “<strong>If you are pleased with me teach me your ways that I may know you….” (Exodus 33:13) </strong>Moses realized that learning God’s way - understanding His precepts and the principles behind them - would acquaint him with the person of God. Lying is wrong because God is true. Stealing is wrong because God is just. Hatred and murder are wrong because God is Love.\r\n\r\n<strong>PRECEPT a PRINCIPLE a PERSON (of God)</strong>\r\n\r\nApplication: If you filter truth through this method, you will see the vast difference from the popular “they say” verses God’s commands, laws, precepts, and ultimately Himself. Mediate on Jesus’ words, “<strong>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. 32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</strong>\r\n\r\nBlessings\r\nPastor Phil"

              "<strong>Philippians 3:10, \"that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI don’t like being referred to as a religious person simply because when we are saved, we are not led to religion but to Christ. That is why we are called Christians. Being referred to as a Christians has also been messed up and soiled by many people and I'm not surprised. Correct me if I am wrong, \"a Christian\" means \"Christ like\" which is <strong>manifesting the qualities </strong>or spirit of Jesus Christ. The word \"manifest\" is to show, display or demonstrate plainly. If that is the case, <strong>your confession of being a Christian has to be accompanied by a demonstration of its definition</strong>. It's amazing to me how people can run around calling themselves Christians but have no Christ like qualities being demonstrated in their lives.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHow will you know what Christ is like without learning of Him? Back in the day, WWJD (What Would Jesus Do?) was very popular. People often asked themselves this question in every life situation that needed answers. Of course this was also opened to abuse as some people came up with ideas of how Christ would have handled some situations contrary to what the bible teaches about Christ. If you do not know who Jesus Christ is or you are not getting to know Him daily, how would you know what He would do? you will merely come up with things labeled Christ like only to discover you are operating in the flesh. I prefer this one coined by Ray Comfort, WDJD (What Did Jesus Do?), this helps me find out and learn more of Him leading me to do what He did to be like Him. <strong>I can only do what He has done to be like Him, creating anything besides that is not of Him.</strong>\r\n\r\nPaul is more responsible for most of the new testament, a person who after his conversion dedicated his life to walk with the Lord. He had done great and mighty things for God, he was well educated, he wrote epistles that revolutionized churches. In spite of it all, he says <strong>Philippians 3:10, \"that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death\". </strong>He craved to know Christ more and more and in that knowing (not head knowledge but intimate knowledge so as to be like Him) All he had done for the Lord would not be compared to knowing Him. He wanted to have a taste of the power of His resurrection. Knowing that if he was going to resurrect, there had to be death in his life. He would die to self for the sake of the call. He also desired to have a fellowship of His suffering in order to appreciate what Christ had done for him.\r\n\r\nI see a man who is not satisfied with what he had done but wanted more. Christians ought to desire more (blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness <strong>Matthew 5</strong>), if you are comfortable and satisfied with what you have and where you are, it's because you haven't been opened to God to reveal to you through His word with an aim to wake you up to desire more to be like Him. My prayer for you and myself is that we would desire more to be like Christ, be imitators of Christ that would mean getting to know Him even more. <strong>I don't just want to know about Christ, I want to know Him , let Him manifest more of His qualities in me.</strong> Blessings Evans"

              "<strong>1Kings 3:16-28, \"So the king answered and said, \"Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him; she is his mother\"</strong>\r\n\r\nFriendships can be broken over different things in life. I’ve seen some broken over relationships, positions, and gifting etc. Good friends, I mean really good friends end their friendships over things that shouldn't, things that don’t matter.\r\n\r\nWe meet two friends who came to king Solomon for judgment. It seems as if they were in the same level, both were prostitutes living in the same house. They must have been good friends to live together. They had a lot of things in common; same occupation (if I may call it that), both gave birth to babies three days apart, both were nurturing babies dear to them, the only thing (person) they can call their own. The bible gives details of these two women who are almost equal in all things. What really keeps two good friends together is it what they have or who they are to each other.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>1Kings 3:19-20, \"19 And this woman's son died in the night, because she lay on him, 20, \"So she arose in the middle of the night and took my son from my side, while your maidservant slept, and laud him in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom\".</strong> We now understand what brought them before the king. I see a friendship being shaken because of a problem, what was equal is not anymore, one of the babies is dead. One lay on her baby most likely by accident and now she is deceiving herself by trying to take the other friend's baby. Trying to live someone else life.\r\n\r\nLet's bring this in our day to day, so many good friends started well but when one friend laid on the good (job, ministry, relationship etc.), and killed it, he or she felt it was not right for the other friend to have something they didn't have or once had. Jealousy finds its way, opening doors to bitterness and resentments. Friends are supposed to build each other even during tough times; a true friend will not be intimidated by your success or the opposite. That is why I praise God for David and Jonathan. Jonathan was a king's son; he knew he was next in line to be king once his father was dead. When he learnt that God had anointed David to take over instead of him, he was at peace with God’s decision. What would that mean today, Jonathan by all means would be looking for ways to get rid of David. Already Jonathan's father King Saul was determined to kill David but Jonathan protected his friend from his father’s wrath, listen to this,<strong> 1Samuel 19:1, \"Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David; but Jonathan... delighted in David\" </strong>because he delighted in him, he warned him, spoke well of David before his father. Remember David was destined to take Jonathan's position and we see Jonathan helping his friend David get there because he loved him, <strong>1Samuel 20:17, \"Now Jonathan again caused David to vow, because he loved him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul\".</strong> This is a friend indeed. Compared to the other two women, one is deceiving herself, here we see loyalty.\r\n\r\nInstead of the one who lay on her child accepting the situation and dealing with it, she refused to go down by herself and took that which did not belong to her and called it her own. I have seen this with believers too, but not to this extreme. Some are bothered when God elevates others before them. Either they will talk behind their backs or accuse them of pride and even disconnect from them. How I pray that friendships will be built that glorify God. Friendships solidified, bound with codes of love that cannot be broken. Jonathan and David were friends indeed. To continue. blessings Evans"

              "<strong>1Kings 3:16-28, \"So the king answered and said, \"Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him; she is his mother\"</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1Kings 3:26, \"Then the woman whose son was living spoke to the king, for she yearned with compassion for her son; and she said, \"O my lord, give her the living child, and by no means kill him\". </strong>We looked at two friends with babies and David and Jonathan. We saw how one of the women was deceiving herself trying to live a life of her friend while Jonathan is out to do everything to protect his friend destined to take his position as king. A good friend will have your back, will care for you no matter what comes in your life that puts you in a higher position than them. A friend who will speak truth in love for he cares so much about your wellbeing.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nAfter the king heard the story of the two women fighting over one baby, he had a solution. His solution was to divide the baby into two and have each one take half of the baby. One woman says, that is a good idea. The one who says it’s okay knows that if that is done, then both will be equal again childless but not with the other. For her, <strong>she would rather lose her son to her one time friend than have the baby killed. She is a friend who has compassion for the living. In other words, I would rather lose than destroy.</strong>\r\n\r\nI love this hymn, \"What a friend we have in Jesus \". A friend indeed, the bible calls Him a friend who sticks closer than a brother. <strong>John 15:13, \"Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for his friends\"</strong>. Can we spot friends who will lay down their lives for other friends? It doesn't matter where I am or what I am to you, all that matters is who I am to you. Jesus laid down His life for the sake of His friends as a sign of love. A friend will let you on the inside, wash your feet and the like. <strong>John 15:15, \"No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you</strong>\". What a friend who does not look at you as a servant because a servant is not let on the inside. A friend is willing to help you get where He is. A friend that declares that greater things than this shall ye do because I go to the Father. A friend that goes down on His knees and washes all manner of feet yet He is the King of kings. He has become a servant of all, <strong>for a good friend is not so much concerned about what he gets from a service but what he gives as a service</strong>.\r\n\r\nWhy do we have so many broken relationships and friendships? It is because people look at what they can get out of a relationship and not so much what they can give. You will submit to a friend because you recognize his or her authority over you. You will not even be intimidated by what they have because you too benefit from what they have. Going back to David and Jonathan, when Jonathan was dead and David took over, David looked for someone left in Jonathan's home and they found a young lame boy. David showed kindness to Jonathan's son because of the friendship and covenant he had with Jonathan. Jesus is a friend who sits on the right hand of God making intercession for us therefore we also thank God for those friends who uphold us in prayers. The friends who encourages us and lets us know that they are standing with us. Jesus had friends and then very close friends (Peter, James, and John), He took them with him to certain places that he wouldn't take the rest of the disciples, He also shared with them deeper stuff.\r\n\r\nMy message this morning is very simple, Friends are supposed to benefit from each other.<strong> God does not bring friends our way for competition but for completion</strong>. There are certain things He will show you through a friend, therefore, you are there to benefit from him or her. We can learn from our greatest friend Jesus and apply the principles of what we have learnt from Him about building friendships and execute them down here. <strong>1Kings 3:27, \"So the king answered and said, \"Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him; she is his mother\". </strong>Because one woman was willing to let go of what was bringing strife, she had compassion, and she realized it was not about her. In the end she received what belonged to her. This is what Jesus did for His friends and this is what we need to do for our friends. What we expect, we can be the first ones to give. Blessings Ev,"

              "<strong>Ruth 1:1-22, \"Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen I talk about the goodness of the Lord and His work, I am reminded of the book of Ruth. If you carefully read this book, you will see how God skillfully patterns two women's lives by causing them to go through different stages of life with an aim to bring them to a level where they can truly understand who God is. Through one of the women we will talk about, her lineage became the line by which David came and through that line Christ comes to us. <strong>When God begins to do something in a life, He will not only look at the present but more so the future. He is making something that will last for a long time.</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe story of Ruth took place sometime during the rule of the judges. Those were dark days for Israel for everyone did as they saw fit in their own eyes. During those times Elimelech and his wife Naomi )interpreted as<strong> \"My pleasant one\") </strong>left Bethlehem which is also interpreted as <strong>\"House of bread\" </strong>to go to Moab a land full of idols. The main reason for the relocation was because of famine in the land of Bethlehem. Elimelech and Naomi had two sons Mahlon and Chilion. These two young men were given names that typifies some kind of dysfunction in their lives. Remember names were not just given in the olden times, names were carefully picked and most of the time it had something to do with the current or future. When Naomi's husband died and so were her two sons married to Moabite women Orpah and Ruth, an here we are told of three widows. One widow is getting old and is losing hope, the other two are still much capable of rebuilding their lives. They only have one mentor, their only friend and they are loyal to each other, their friendship is strong and their commitment to each other is solid. They all have lost something but they still have each other to help them deal with the grief, pain, the fiercest storms. We need friends the most when we are dealing with tough times, when fear is knocking at the door and all the hope and strength has left the door, a friend who will stick closer is what you need, who will hear you out, who will encourage and strength you. <strong>Proverbs 18:24, \"A man that has friends must himself be friendly, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother\". </strong>A friend that lets you know that it will be alright, a friend to boost your faith, a friend that will pray for and with you, and who is a better friend than <strong>JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH</strong>, <strong>Mathew 28:20, \"...lo, I am with you, even unto the end of the world\".</strong>\r\n\r\nRuth and Orpah had nothing to tie them to Naomi, they were free by the law to remarry, they had a chance to abandon Naomi who was getting old. They were stuck in the middle for where they came from was not pleasant and where they were was not pleasant either. Naomi was about to make a drastic change of going back to her home land empty handed. She left with much trying to run away from the house of bread during tough time but now she is coming back empty handed and of age. <strong>Ruth 1:6, \"Then she rose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the Lord had visited His people (Israel) by giving them bread\". </strong>A very tough decision to make, one part is to face her situation head on the other part is to break a bond that she already made.\r\n\r\nPart 1 is lay a ground work for us to understand that there are and will be times when we are caught in the middle of situations, and the choices we make during those times can change the course of our lives either for a short time or forever. Going back is not an option when have invested so much into your tough situation. God will let you know that there is bread in His house (Bethlehem) and you have to make a choice to fight all the fears, doubts, pride and the thought of what people will think of you when you make the move and take a stand. We are not destined to spend the rest of our lives in Moab when there is bread in Bethlehem. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Ruth 1:1-22, \"Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her\"</strong>\r\n\r\nOne woman decided to go back to her people but had to a face head on a problem, she had two friends who had been related to her by marriage at one point. With the death of her sons, there was actually nothing in the family line to tie them together apart from the bond of friendship they developed over the years.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Ruth 1:8-9, “8 And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, \"go return each to her mother's house. The Lord deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me\", 9 \"The Lord grant that you may find rest, each in the house of her husband</strong>\". In the previous verse, Naomi began a journey out of the land of Moab to return to Judah (Bethlehem), she has her daughters-in-law but in the middle of journey she pauses to talk to some sense to these two women she calls her daughters. Though hard to kiss the friendships goodbye, she speaks a blessing over them as she releases them back to their homes. Naomi had journey to embark on, a lot of past issues to deal with, she could not stand bringing her friends into this kind of misery. <strong>Ruth 1:9, \"...So she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept\", vs. 10, \"And they said to her, \"Surely we will return with you to your people\". </strong>If you look carefully, you will see that Naomi had introduced them to a new life style where the true God was seen in the life of Naomi something they may have desired. Today mothers-in-law and the daughter's in law always clash and we see a perfect example of what friendship is all about breaking every barriers and boundaries from these three women who have very little in common. Naomi has a concern for these two young women's future that she puts their desires a head of hers, she cares more about their lives than hers and she is willing to advise them on what to do. Even with the explanation, they refused to go back for 1. the past looked so bad (full of darkness, idols, no hope, confusion). Who in their right mind would want to go back to such a place? 2.,They had suffered together, walked together, built a bond that was not going to be easily broken. All they were saying in other words was that, <strong>they came too far to go back</strong>.\r\n\r\nQuestion that arises is in <strong>Ruth 1:11, \"...why will you go back with me? </strong>to add to that question, <em>“What have you seen in me to want to journey with me? Is it because you see that there could be hope to gain more sons that will in turn marry you and we will continue with the family tree? Check again, I am old and the Lord has gone against me, there is no hope to get a husband and be married again and bare children and even if that happened, would you patiently wait till they are grown to marry you? To top it all, where I am going is not promised that it will be okay, are you sure you want to take the risk?”,</em> Perhaps are this point they were beginning to see Naomi's reasoning of preventing them from coming back with her. What a friend who is concerned about the welfare of others; what she had, she gave it freely. <strong>Ruth 1:14</strong>, <strong>\"Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law...\" </strong>The first time the two women were ready to journey with Naomi but with Orpah convinced by the argument stated and a sense that there could be no hope, they wept once again and she kissed Naomi goodbye. She was not willing to suffer anymore, she could not see the light at the end of the tunnel. The person who could still give her hope had just declared that she had nothing else left to give, what else can she do but go back to Moab, to her people, to her gods.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile <strong>Ruth 1:14, \"...Ruth clung to her\". </strong>Did Ruth miss to hear what Naomi said? there is nothing left to tie them together and there is no guarantee that things will get better so once again Naomi tried to speak some sense to her, <strong>Ruth 1:15, \"And she said, \"Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law\". </strong>Everyone has a choice to be to make, people can influence you either the wrong way or the right way. The decision you make will affect you for a long time. The decision we make shouldn't be based on what someone else made. Their convictions could be different from yours and what they have been exposed to could show whether they are ready to journey forward or backward. Orpah is gone but Ruth said in verse<strong> 16, \"Entreat me not to live you, or turn back from following after you; forever you will go, I will go; And wherever you will lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people, And your God, my God. vs. 17, \"Where you die, I will die, And there will I be buried. The Lord do so to me, more also, if anything but death parts you and me\". </strong>That requires boldness and conviction. One says our situation is just too much to keep us together, the other says, we will work it out together. Sounds like marriage for one party says for better or for worse, I will stick with you (good marriage), the other party says, there is so much to deal with that I am not ready for (shaky marriage).\r\n\r\nEvery person is in dire need of at least one faithful friend, or mate who will look him or her in the eye and say, \"<strong>I will never leave you”</strong>. You may grow old and gray, but I will not leave you. The years may be cruel and the times may be hard, but I'll be here. I will never leave you. We might have met under different circumstance and those things might be gone but one thing I know for sure that the circumstance allowed us to start something that could never be easily broken and replaced by the current times. You are all that I've got and I will be with you till the end. How would you rate you commitment to your friend Jesus? how about a friend or the people you care about? does your loyalty and faithfulness ever waver? With whom are you a friend forever? Pray for that person(s) today. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Ruth 1:1-22, \"Then they lifted up their voices and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her\"</strong>\r\n\r\nSometime back my pastor talked about making Godly decisions. Decisions that will not only affect you today but for many days, months and even years to come. We have talked about the same with the life of Ruth and Naomi making decisions to change locations when there appeared to be no light at the end of the tunnel.<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Ruth 1:18, \"When she saw that she was determined to go with her (Naomi), she stopped speaking to her. vs. 19, \"Now the two of them went until they came to Bethlehem...\"</strong> I want us to see something from this story. Naomi went to Moab a land where she could not fit in and Ruth was now heading to a land where she did not fit in. Both of them could not go back to the past they could not fit in anymore. They embarked on a journey to find a place to fit it in. They had been told that Bethlehem had been remembered by God and God had graciously provided for His people but the question is, would these two women fit in? They journeyed to a blessed land, a land visited by God. That is definitely making a Godly decision for God is our only source and refuge.\r\n\r\nNaomi is like the prodigal daughter who left home with so much and now she was coming back empty handed, she did not even want to be called the pleasant one anymore the way her name suggests. All she wanted was to be called Mara which means the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. She was looking at herself as a failure however when the arrived, they were both welcomed and embraced regardless of where they had been. People did not care about Naomi's history, they cared for who she was and had always been. Even through all the afflictions, later you will hear of how she maintained her integrity. Through her life style, she builds the life of Ruth who was spoken highly of for she had one of the best characters anyone could ever admire.\r\n\r\nOrpah cared much about what could benefit her rather than how they could team together and progress. Many have friends when they have everything together, a true friend will stick by your side when you need them the most, during trying times. When the going became tough, she abandoned the other two and went back to where she came from while these two moved to new dimensions.\r\n\r\nSomething about Ruth, she was compassionate, she took to heart what her mother in law taught. The future may have not been promising but she stuck by Naomi for comfort, for strength and for encouragement. Friendship has no boundaries, no age barriers, no timing. It has everything to do with commitment and investment. A friend to fight with, a friend to tell about what you are dealing with, a friend's shoulder to cry on, a friend to encourage and let you know it will be alright, a friend to go an extra mile.

              "<strong>Psalm 103:7, \"He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI wondered why Moses was shown God's ways while the Israelites were only shown God's acts. Knowing God's way is knowing Him and His style of doing things, knowing the timing, knowing that you can trust Him and even knowing that He has everything under control. The children of Israel only knew His acts in that any time God did not do something for them in a tough situation, they would murmur and complain. Moses led about 2.5 million people out of Egypt without an army and it’s because He knew God's ways when many complained. People who do not know God’s ways will always be complainers, people on the verge of living by miracles and can't see anything beyond that. <!--more-->They are people who have happiness when everything is going the right way. Their happiness depends on circumstances. When you know God’s ways, <strong>you will have joy, unspeakable joy full of the glory of God at all times</strong>. Joy does not depend on circumstance, joy goes with the fact that you know who is in charge. Therefore whether things are going right or wrong, I will still have the joy rather than happiness. <strong>I don't have to see it to trust Him; and I don't have to have it to thank Him, I know in whom I have believed</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 86:11, \"Teach me Your way, O Lord and I will walk in your truth: Unite my heart to fear Your name\". </strong>I love the way the psalmist puts it. Instead of him praying “<strong>show me your acts</strong>”, he asking to be taught God's ways. He knows that learning God's ways will keep him from being discouraged and broken when things don’t go his way. He says teach me to walk in Your truth to avoid living in deception, without killing my trust in You, without aborting what You have started in me even when I do not see your acts. Knowing God's ways will teach you to fear His name even more, He is God who completes His promises regardless of the time or the season.<strong> Psalm 119:105, \"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path (way)</strong>\", The word of the Lord is the truth, <strong>John 14:6, \"Jesus says unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life</strong>\", <strong>John 1:1, \"In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God</strong>\", He is also the light, <strong>John 9:5, \"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world</strong>\". All these truths about Christ should lead us to trust Him and take Him at His word. His word is a lamp unto our feet, guiding us, directing us, showing us His ways. His light cannot go dim, it's bright in the day and in the night, darkness cannot comprehend Him. When His light comes in, darkness has no choice but to leave. We live in a world full of darkness but God will shine His way for us.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalms 25:4&amp;5, \"Show me Your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation On You I wait all the day\". </strong>Three key words in these two verses are significant. <strong>When He shows You His ways He has your attention; when He teaches you His paths, He has your mind; and when He leads you in His truth, He has your hand</strong>. He has to show me His ways before He can teach me, and He has to teach me His paths before He can lead me in His truth. What more can one ask of the Lord than to know how God operates. I would prefer knowing His ways to knowing His acts. His ways will teach me how to call on Him, depend on Him and more so have an intimate relationship with Him. To know His acts is to only look to Him when I need something and that will be it, I will not experience Him on a day to day basis because I will only see Him when He moves. \"...<strong>For You are the God of my salvation On You I wait all the day\". </strong>You and I can wait on God all day without being frustrated for He will sure come (not that he left anyway). How I pray that we will begin by desiring to know <strong>His ways rather than His acts for greater weight lies on His ways</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 25:9, \"The humble He guides in justice: and the humble He teaches His way\", </strong>The reason why God taught Moses His ways was because He was a humble man. He trusted him with over 2.5million for God knew that Moses would look to Him for help at any time of day or night. Moses could believe God for something that had not happened yet and He could also remain calm in tough situations, he trusted God’s ways. <strong>Psalm 103:7, \"He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel\". With this understanding, I prefer His ways to His acts!, Blessings Ev</strong>\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/from-knowing-about-christ-to-knowing-christ-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">From Knowing About Christ To Knowing Christ, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/08/08/fill-me-to-over-flow-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Fill Me To Over Flow, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>1Kings 18:41-45, \"Then it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, “There is a cloud, as small as a man’s hand, rising out of the sea!” So he said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot, and go down before the rain stops you.’\"</strong>\r\n\r\nGod answers prayers, I am a firm believer of that, He amazes me as to how He does answer prayers. If you are going to expect a miracle from God, don't be surprised if He does it in a way you never imagined. He is a God of surprises therefore you have to know <strong>HIS WAYS </strong>to know when He is moving. The bible says in <strong>Psalm 103:7, \"He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel\". </strong>Many only rejoice in the acts of God and that is okay but knowing His acts limits you to understanding how He does things. Moses was not frustrated when God was not acting, He knew God's ways to know how and when God would move. <!--more--><strong>When you know God's ways, even if He does not act, you can see why He hasn't acted and you can see what He is doing in your life as he prepares you for the miracle.</strong> The Potter can only make a jar because He has something to put in it. How will a broken leaking jar hold anything poured into it? If your jar is leaking, if He was to pour that miracle in you, it will definitely leak out. That was the problem with the Israelites, they were leaking vessels always needing an act of God to keep them going. When the miracle leaked out, they cried some more. Are we not like that many times praying for miracles when our jars are leaking? I would rather know His ways than His acts.\r\n\r\nElijah has just prayed calling on heaven and instantly God answered him by fire in vs. 38. What an instant miracle, God answering by fire what He had prayed. I have had those moments when I prayed and instantly God granted my request. Then moving to vs. 41, Elijah operates by faith, he tells king Ahab<strong>, \"Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain\"</strong>. Was there a great sound of rain? I don't think so because as you read, Elijah sent his servant to go up and look toward the sea. Six times he was sent to check and six times he came back to tell Elijah there is nothing. Thinking of this servant, he had seen Elijah call fire from heaven and it fell immediately, how come another miracle is taking forever to be manifested? I believe the servant must have gotten tired and frustrated running back and forth. Meanwhile, Elijah was cool, calm and collected because He knew the ways of God. He understood God was is in control and though it had not happened as he had prophesied, he could visualize in his spirit and embrace it. With that he was not getting frustrated, he was patient. <strong>When God promises, I don't want to concentrate much on the timing for the promise to be fulfilled, I want to embrace the truth that He has promised</strong>. And according to His ways, \"He is not a man that He should lie\". Learning His ways will cause you to keep checking, keep praying, keep knocking, and keep seeking because He has shown you what He wants to do in your life.\r\n\r\n<strong>1Kings 18:44, \"Then it came to pass the seventh time, that he said, “There is a cloud, as small as a man’s hand, rising out of the sea!” </strong>Elijah sent his servant for the seventh time and finally he saw a small cloud as a man's hand, rising out of the sea. The miracle of fire happened instantly and big, the next miracle required patience and when it was revealed, it appeared very small. Can you imagine the servant thinking, \"<em>I've been running back and forth for something this small\"?</em> Do you realize that there are times we dismiss miracles God is performing in our lives because they look small? We expected something big and all that appeared was a small cloud as a man's hand. What we failed to understand was that, abundance tends to start small. The reason the bible says, \"<strong>do not despise the days of humble (miracles) beginnings\". </strong>Knowing God's ways will teach you to see miracles begin even in small scales. <strong>The miracle life of a baby begins long before he or she is born</strong>. In conclusion, knowing God's ways will help you live a fulfilled life knowing miracles can be instantly or could take long (days, weeks, months, years). If He has conceived the promise in your spirit, be sure he will birth it in His time, don’t abort.

              "<strong>Psalm 40:1, \"I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry” (NIV) </strong>\r\n\r\nWalking with the Lord is never easy. If you see someone faithfully walking with the Lord it's not because it's easier for them than others, it's because they are determined to walk with the Lord faithfully, totally relying on Him for strength. And it's in the process of walking with the Lord you realize that His <strong>ways are not your ways and His thoughts are not your thoughts, that as high as the heavens is from the earth so are His thoughts and His ways (Paraphrased). </strong>This teaches you not to think and deal with God the way you and I would with others. Learning His ways and not our ways eliminates frustrations. A thousand years is like a minute to God therefore when you pray and God says wait a minute, it may mean, wait for a while.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nTo wait on God is to stop dictating God when and how He should do things and let Him be God in your situation. Last time I checked, He wasn't looking for your opinion and ideas to get things done. His word says <strong>Psalm 46:10, \"Be still and know that I am God</strong>\". If you are going to walk with the Lord, you have to get into His program and not yours.\r\n\r\n<strong>Psalm 40:1, \"I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry”. (NIV) </strong>. David understood a secret that he applied in his life, the secret of patiently waiting for the Lord. Let's break it down, \"<strong>I waited</strong>\", this deals with time, His timing and not mine. <strong>Ecclesiastes 3:11, \"He has made everything beautiful in its time</strong>\", Learn God's time. He has <strong>divinely implanted sense of a purpose working through the ages which nothing under the sun but God alone can satisfy.</strong> Faith and patience go hand in hand, <strong>faith is awaiting God's timing without doubting His love and ability.</strong> \"…<strong>Patiently</strong>\" deals with the process. You are not ready to progress with God without patience as part of God's process in your life. That’ is what patience is all about. <strong>\"…For the Lord</strong>\", the reason behind the waiting. David learnt that everything he had desired of the Lord depended on waiting patiently for the Lord to come through for him and because he mastered it, God turned and heard his cry. Abraham needed to go through the same process, in the middle he felt impatient and tried to answer his own prayer by bringing Ishmael. He felt he was running out of time in relation to how he looked at himself. You know the rest of the story. Think of bringing an Ishmael, God is thinking of bringing an Isaac, the true blessing He has promised his servant.\r\n\r\nI see how praying and waiting patiently for the Lord to move in different areas has yielded fruits. There are some areas when I look back it felt like I missed my Isaac (true blessing). Nothing was coming forth and thought of settling for Ishmael (man made promise) was very strong. For example, I patiently waited for 8 years to meet and marry the woman God had for me. It wasn't the easiest thing to do, at times I felt like I had missed God's will for my life in the area of marriage, at times I felt like I wasn't doing something right. Days of discouragements were there but I held on to His word waiting for His timing without doubting His love and ability. In His time He blessed me with Judy (we’ve been married 7 years). I am thankful to God I waited for His true blessing. I know I don't deserve the best but I always desired the best, God knows how to give the best. Those who are desiring to meet someone and settle down, don't give up patiently waiting on God. Don't doubt His love and ability, and most definitely, don't settle for an Ishmael when God has designed an Isaac for you. One is a true blessing from the Lord, the other is a false blessing made by man. What God gives, He blesses. A final thought, <strong>It's not that the Lord is preparing the blessing for you, the blessing is ready, you are the one who needs preparation for the blessing, that is the difference and that requires patiently waiting on the Lord.

              "<strong>John 8:36, \"Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed\"</strong>\r\n\r\nCan born again Christians be demon possessed? It is not possible. <strong>Christians don't get demon possessed, however they can be demon oppressed and influenced</strong>. What is the difference between the two? to be possessed is to be owned by someone or to be controlled, dominated, in other words, be a master's slave. Born again Christians are not owned or mastered by demons, they do not belong to the devil, <strong>1John 4:4, \"Ye are of God little children and have overcome them: because greater is He that is in you than he (demons) that is in the world</strong>\". We are of God, automatically we have overcome them. Though we can’t fight or have no strength to fight, Him present in us is enough to scare the demonic forces, why? <strong>James 2:29, \"You believe that there is one God; You do well. Even the demons believe and tremble\". The battle is not primarily against a believer but the truth a believer possesses, fighting God in a believer.<!--more--></strong>\r\n\r\nNow let's look at the word “oppressed”. Oppressed is to keep down by severe and unjust use of force or authority. It is to weigh heavily, to overwhelm with an aim to crush. The work of the devil and his demons on Christian is to keep them down, accuse them, use force and authority to make sure he is down. He goes about putting heavy things on the back of Christians to overwhelm them. He is constantly looking for loop holes to come in and oppress, but thanks be to God for a strategy to overcome, <strong>1Peter 5:8, \"Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion, walks about seeking souls he may devour\". </strong>Being sober is being aware of the tactics of the enemy and when he strikes. Being vigilant is always being alert for we have seen, he is always walking about trying to find those who are not sober and vigilant. He is roaring (like) a lion, that means that he is not the lion he tries to sound like one. This can be looked at in two ways, when he roars like a lion, if you are not careful, you might think that he is the lion and blame Christ for all that you are going through. The bible says, <strong>\"My sheep knows my voice</strong>\" <strong>therefore we have to distinguish between who roars like the lion and who is the Lion</strong>. <strong>Jesus Christ is the LION OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH!!!</strong>\r\n\r\nWhy is this so important? because we were not called into bondage but into freedom and freedom only comes from and through Jesus Christ. Everyone at times get oppressed through failures, sickness, confusion, frustrations, bitterness etc. You want to be free but can't seem to find that freedom. Here is how the freedom comes about, <strong>Isaiah 10:27, \"It shall come to pass in that day that his burden will be taken away from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck and the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing</strong>\". We have a burden of heaviness laid on us by the enemy to oppress us, the bible says that it has to be taken off the shoulder. The yoke is the next in line, when you are oppressed, the enemy tries very hard to lead you to his ways and you are fighting to walk in God's ways. So the yoke has to be taken off. Here is the key, \"<strong>And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing</strong>\", if you take off the yoke and put it aside, it's easy for it to be slipped back. If you break the yoke, there is a possibility that it can be put back together. If you destroy it, case closed!!! Look at even documents, if the evidence is destroyed, nothing can be done to bring them back but if you just tear them into pieces, it's easy to try and put them back together and make some sense out of them. The anointing from above destroys the yoke never to be put back together, <strong>Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed\" John 8:36, and what better tool to free oneself from the oppression but by the Inspired, Inherent, Sufficient Word of God. That is our weapon mighty in God to free us. It’s the tool by which we become sober and vigilant.

              "<strong>Luke 9:23, “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me”</strong>\r\n\r\nReceiving Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior is the first step to salvation and gateway to God’s kingdom and to the blessings promised in His Word, the Bible. Above and beyond that, Christians are called to a daily walk with Jesus in order for them to receive the abundant life Jesus came to give(<strong>John 10:10</strong>), live victorious life, do the will of God here on earth and finally, reach heaven, where we shall live in glory with Jesus forever.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe verse above is very clear about the terms and conditions required to following Jesus. Jesus himself gave these terms. He never modified them or relaxed them later on. The church, religion, society or you might have tried to re state the demands in lesser demanding ways, to accommodate our sinful desires, willful disobedience to God’s truth. Good and easy as our own ways for following Christ may sound, they will never earn us heaven, and we can never experience true Christian life and walk the way Jesus intended for us.\r\n\r\nReceiving Jesus as Lord and Savior demands not only believing the truth of the gospel, but also committing ourselves to sacrificially follow him. The choice to follow Him in His ways is ours to make, daily. It is not an occasional, or Sunday morning choice. It is not a choice we are expected to make when it is easier or convenient or when we don’t feel embarrassed, or intimidated by the presences of some people. The choice is personal and is made daily, decisively, consciously, prayerfully and faithfully commit yourself to fulfilling the obligation without anyone supervising or pushing you to do so. Your pusher and supervisor is the Lord Jesus, through his Holy Spirit dwelling in you. Without the Holy Spirit presence and working in you, you or anyone else cannot follow Jesus. All Christians must depend on Him, daily, for strength, wisdom and power to follow Him.\r\n\r\nDo you take up your cross daily and follow him? Take up His cross. The cross of Christ is a symbol of suffering and unselfishness (<strong>1Peter 2:21; 4:31),</strong> death (<strong>Acts 10:39),</strong> shame (<strong>Hebrews 12:2</strong>), ridicule (<strong>Matthew 27:39</strong>), rejection (<strong>1Peter. 2:4</strong>), and self-denial (<strong>Matthew 16:24</strong>).\r\n\r\nWhen we believers take up our cross and follow Christ, we deny our own selves and commit ourselves to three areas of suffering:\r\n1. We suffer a lifelong battle against sin by crucifying our own fleshly desires. You may not like sin, but sin likes you. Sin will follow you daily if you don’t carry your cross and follow Jesus daily.\r\n2. We suffer in a war against Satan and the powers of darkness as we advance the kingdom of God. We experience rejection and face hostilities and obstacles along the way. We contend with false teachings and doctrines of demons, men and religion.\r\n3. We suffer the reproach, hatred and ridicule of the world by testifying in love that its deeds are evil, by separating ourselves from it both morally and spiritually, and by refusing to accept its standards or philosophy as our own (<strong>1Corinthians1:21-27).</strong>\r\n\r\nTo avoid becoming a victim of Satan’s deceit and discouragement, make your lifetime profession to do three things as commanded by Christ: <strong>deny yourself, take up your cross daily, and follow Jesus daily</strong>. There is no short cut! There is no other alternative. The terms are clearly set. If you follow, you will be blessed and you will see God. <strong>Let us walk today with Christ of the cross as we carry the cross of Christ! </strong>God bless you. Brother Boaz Olang"

              "<strong>James 1:8, \"A double minded man is unstable in all his ways\"</strong>\r\n\r\nWe always want clear sense of direction when making major decisions. There are times we seek advice in situations to help us make better judgments. From my experience, it’s very dangerous to make hasty decision without weighing things. People can advise and give guidance, making decision is your responsibility.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, let us come to the standard set for us in heaven to live by. <strong>James 4:8, \"Draw nigh unto God, and He will draw nigh to you, cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts, ye double minded\". </strong>Sin soils our hearts and minds that we become easily desensitized to what is clear and required of God. With that, anything we do, we do it either ignorantly or we just don't care. We can be pulled by things that are enticing with a promise to give fulfillment and happiness only to find out later they are traps. One side of you pulls you to what is right, the other side pulls you to something that looks right. You are set in the middle trying to make a wise decision as to what path to take. It's either black or white, no shades of gray in the middle; it's either right or wrong can't accept both at the same time and a choice has to be made. I'm amazed that some can have a foot in the church and have another in the world, they worship today tomorrow you see them doing something else, James tells us something interesting, he says that for you to be single minded, you need to draw nigh to God and God will draw nigh to you. As you draw nigh to God, God begins to cause you to see things clearly where you have to make a choice of cleansing your hands and purifying your heart. You will not know what is right until you have encountered with the truth. <strong>John 8:32, \"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free\".</strong> It's not just a matter of knowing the truth, many already do, it's a matter of knowing the truth, walking it, living it, exercising it. It has a way of making you a single minded person.\r\n\r\n<strong>John 14:6, \"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh to the Father, but by me\". </strong>We can see Jesus singling Himself out by calling Himself THE WAY, THE TRUTH, and THE LIFE. If He had used the word “A” instead of “THE”, then He would be another option but when He said “HE IS”, this teaches us that the only way we can have a single mind is by trusting in Jesus alone for salvation, guidance, protection, provision and every other thing that we need. A double minded person will try and have other options, like trust in God today but also have connections to psychic, or trust in God and have his faith on the lottery ticket in his hands. It’s hard for such to focus, direction, purpose, vision, and conviction because he has the ability of changing his mind anytime. <strong>Psalm 118:8, \"It is better to trust in the Lord than to put your confidence in man\", </strong>He says, <strong>\"Choose ye this day whom you will serve</strong>\", \"<strong>Behold I have set before you curses and blessings, choose wisely</strong>\". A single minded person will choose wisely without feeling pressured into something that he knows is not acceptable.\r\n\r\n<strong>James 1:8, \"A double minded man is unstable in all his was\". I could say “</strong>Double” is to apply equality in the things that come in one's way and now he or she is set to battle which way to go. The verse concludes by saying that such a person is unstable in all his ways simply because they will be tossed around by everything that comes their way. They will believe any doctrine that comes their way, they will always be convinced by others to take a different direction.\r\n\r\n<strong>Isaiah 26:3, \"Thou shall keep him in perfect peace whose mind stays on thee\", </strong>let's keep our minds stay (dwell) on Him, <strong>Romans 12:2, \"And be ye not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove that which is good acceptable, and perfect will of God\".</strong> The patterns and life style in this world would cause your mind and mine to wander and that is why the bible says not to be conformed by it. We want our minds be transformed and renewed that we may prove (test) what is good not what we perceive to be good. Jesus had a single mind and Paul encourages us in <strong>Philippians 2:5, \"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus...\"</strong>\r\n\r\nSee how the mind plays one of the major roles in a human life, the devil attacks the mind and so the Lord deals with the heart first because if He can get to the heart, the heart will transform the entire body including the mind. All defeat, pride, lust, deceptions begin in the mind so we need to guard the mind at all cost to think on what is acceptable will of God in Christ Jesus. Let's have single minds which comes from looking unto Jesus the Author and the Finisher of our faith. Have the mind of Christ, a sound mind and uncorrupted.

              "<strong>Job 10:15-16, “If I be wicked, woe to me; and if I be righteous, yet I will not lift up my head. I am full of confusion: Therefore see my affliction; for it increases. You hunt me as a fierce lion; and again you show yourself marvelous to me.”</strong>\r\n\r\nJob is in a state of confusion here. He is willing to take an honest assessment of himself although still not coming up with an answer to his situation. How many of us would be willing to take such an honesty test. This can be helpful for us if done right or harmful to us if done wrong. Let me explain. Many of us either think too less of ourselves, or more highly than we ought to. So we either look like the next best thing to sliced bread, or worse than the scum of the earth. Neither of these outlooks speaks balance and order. <strong>If we are Christians we are NOT even sinners saved by grace</strong>. <strong>We are saints that struggle with sin</strong>. Why do I say this, because the Apostle Paul NEVER wrote to the “sinner’s saved by grace” in Ephesus, Corinth, Galatia, etc…. NO, he wrote to the saints in those places. I will save \"the sinner saint devotion\" for another time soon. However I will say we need to look at ourselves in the right way, like Job.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHe said of himself, “<strong>If I be wicked, woe to me</strong>;” He was willing to dig up any possible link to wickedness in his life. Job was the kind of man that knew the Lord desired <strong>“Truth in the inward parts</strong>” of our lives. However, he couldn’t put his finger on any wicked dealings that he had taken part in, whether actions, thoughts, or intentions. Job was serious about sin, wickedness, and uncleanliness before the Lord. Oh, that we would be as serious about these same things as Job was.\r\n\r\nHe also said of himself, “<strong>And if I be righteous, yet I will not lift up my head</strong>.” WOW, if he looked great in God’s eyes he wouldn’t even lift up his head [on high]. Perhaps Job knew that it was <strong>God that would be a shield around him, the one that would bestow glory on him and be the lifter of his head. (Psalms 3:3) </strong>Job wanted to be careful if things looked great in his integrity that he would not brag in self-righteousness. Pride comes before a fall, and so one need proceed with caution or better yet humility when we are doing well. In an oath that I have to say as part of my job part of one line says <strong>“I will remain humble in my accomplishments...,”</strong>which is a good reminder to us to look at ourselves in truth. <strong>1Peter 5:6-7 reads, “Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you”. </strong>Perhaps Job realized this when he said “<strong>I am full of confusion</strong>.” He had cares upon his mind, because he couldn’t place his finger upon his situation. His “friends” certainly didn’t help at all.\r\n\r\nHe asks that Lord to look upon his afflictions because they increase as a fierce lion; “<strong>AND AGAIN SHOW YOURSELF MARVELOUS UPON ME</strong>.” It seemed that Job was saying that it did not make any difference whether he was innocent or guilty because he was full of shame and drowned in affliction anyhow (vv. 14-15). No matter how much he tried to assert his integrity, it seems that God insisted on stalking Job like a lion, showing his awesome power in wave after wave of oppression. Job still recognized God’s awesome power. He knew that only God has the awesome power to turn these things away from Job, and bring any sense and comfort to Job.\r\n\r\n<strong>Job says in 13:15 “Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; I will surely defend my ways to his face</strong>”. Job felt that his ways pleased the Lord and that the Lord knew that and would take that into account, so even if God killed Job, he would still hope in the Lord.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do when you’re confused? Do you take an honest assessment of yourself? Most of us don’t have the integrity of Job; however could we have the humility of Job whether wicked or righteous? Blessings Phil"

              "<strong>Ecclesiastes 7:12, \"For wisdom is a defense as money is a defense, But the excellence of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to those who have it.”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6098\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"284\" height=\"177\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nI have come to learn in my own life a huge difference between wisdom and knowledge. Knowledge is being aware, learning by teaching. Wisdom is having knowledge and applying it in different ways to produce a result that is even greater. Wisdom is well calculated options to make something better while knowledge may sometimes be one way in the sense that if you learned it this way, it’s got be done that way. <!--more-->The bible puts both of them in different verses and are very significant, <strong>Proverbs 9:10, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the holy is understanding\", Proverbs 1:7, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but the fools despise wisdom and instruction\"</strong>. I know people who never went to school and but have such wisdom. I believe that wisdom is mostly learnt from experience.\r\n\r\n<strong>1King 3:5,\"At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, “Ask! What shall I give you?” \", </strong>and Solomon said<strong> vs. 9, \"Therefore give to Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people, that I may discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of Yours?”</strong> Solomon was crowned the next king, then the Lord appeared and gave him an open check to ask for anything he could desire. What he goes for is <strong>wisdom (understanding, discerning). </strong>What would you have asked for? lots of money, a big house, material things? Solomon asked for nothing but wisdom to judge his people wisely and fairly. Without wisdom, you could have everything you desire, and most likely those things will kill you.\r\n\r\nGive someone a million dollars and see what happens, if one has never been trained, or skilled to handle that kind of money, it will destroy him. If you let someone go through different process of learning to utilize, being a good steward, learning to invest, be generous, you give him little by little, they become content and faithful. When they arrive at the top, you give them that kind of money, it will not bring them down because they are wise<strong>. Mathew 25:22-23, \"22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them. 23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things</strong>\". It's a matter of being faithful with the little that you increase in a job position or ministry that God makes you ruler over much. Many people want to be enlarged but they have problems maintaining where they are. Some want to make progress but are not faithful in that which is little. If you are given anything that you are not prepared for, either it will destroy you or you will destroy it. Don't be discouraged because you are not where you want to be; be like Joseph who was faithful even in the small beginnings and God in due time entrusted him with larger things because he had demonstrated that he could be trusted. Through his small beginnings, he learnt more of wisdom and understanding that when he reached to the top, he became one of the most humble people on earth.\r\n\r\nSolomon did not ask for riches, he asked for wisdom, listen to God's reaction <strong>1Kings 3:10,</strong> \"<strong>And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing”. </strong>Now listen to God's word to Solomon <strong>1Kings 3:11-13, “11 Then God said to him: “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked long life for yourself, nor have asked riches for yourself, nor have asked the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice, 12 behold, I have done according to your words; see, I have given you a wise and understanding heart, so that there has not been anyone like you before you, nor shall any like you arise after you. 13 And I have also given you what you have not asked: both riches and honor, so that there shall not be anyone like you among the kings all your days.</strong>.\". <strong>Ecclesiastes 7:12, \"For wisdom is a defense as money is a defense, But the excellence of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to those who have it. \"</strong>\r\n\r\nFor this new king, wisdom was going to be his number one defense, wisdom had an opportunity to sustain and keep him. The bible already declared the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. He understood that if the Lord was going to bring something in his life, he was going to be required to apply wisdom. The wisdom he asked for was his defense all the days of his life. Now riches comes in (spiritual, material according to His will), some have said that money is the root of all evil, I don't agree but I do know that <strong>the</strong> <strong>LOVE of money is the root of all kinds of evil. </strong>If money was evil, we wouldn't need to work but somewhere also the bible says that <strong>money answers all things</strong>. The people who love money have no understanding of wisdom but if you do, self-control is employed and you are reminded that whatever the Lord brings to your life, you are expected to be a good steward. The last part of <strong>Ecclesiastes 7:12, \"... but the excellence of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to them those that have it\"</strong>, my understanding of this verse, <strong>wisdom gives life to them that have money (material blessings). </strong>How do we gain wisdom, by fearing the Lord. It all comes down to what is my motive for wanting more. Solomon desired wisdom, but what was his motive for desiring wisdom? Be faithful wherever you are placed, gain wisdom and experience to get you to the next level and check your motives. Everything can and will leave, but Wisdom is your defense.\r\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size:1em;\">Related articles</h6>\r\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\r\n\t<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/2013/08/04/lest-we-lose-focus-evans-olang/\" target=\"_blank\">Lest We Lose Focus, Evans Olang</a> (magnifyhisword.wordpress.com)</li>\r\n</ul>"

              "<strong>Matthew 19:16-22,”16 Now behold, one came and said to Him, “Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?” 17 So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”</strong>\r\n\r\nI am a firm believer of going out of my way to speak to the lost about the gospel. There is nothing wrong witnessing with our lifestyle which is important, I just believe we live in a time where people are not searching to know the truth and therefore we have to go out of our way and awaken them to their need of a Savior. For the last 20 years I have been a Christian, I have never encountered with anyone who came to me to ask how they can be saved or the hope that is in me. The bible says in <strong>John 3:19, “and this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness, rather than light, because their deeds were evil</strong>”. This is one of the reasons people are not seeking to be saved, they love darkness and they don’t want the light to expose it so they will not ask.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nI will share another reason why people don’t ask shortly. <strong>Mathew 19, Mark 10 and Luke 18</strong> tells us about a young rich ruler who out of nowhere came to Jesus and asked, <strong>“…Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?” </strong>. There is a lot to chew on this verse alone. If someone came and asked me how they can receive eternal life, I would really rejoice for I have never had anyone do that. Anyway, we would ask ourselves many questions as to the intentions of this young rich ruler. Mark the things that describe him, he was young, rich and a ruler. He had everything going for him. What would make a man of his status seek to know what he was to do to have eternal life? Perhaps he wanted to make sure he got it right, or he wanted to see if Jesus really knew what it took to have eternal life or maybe he was really seeking the truth.\r\n\r\nLook at how he addresses Jesus, <strong>“Good Teacher…”</strong>, his introduction of Jesus already raises a red flag. First, Jesus was more than a good teacher, He was (is) the Messiah, the Savior of the world. He was God in the flesh and no one who has a wrong understanding of who He is can be saved. Today in talking to people, they are ok saying Jesus was a good teacher, a good prophet, a good man and even Son of God. See their faces change when you declare that Jesus Christ was (is) God.\r\n\r\nThen the rich man asked <strong>“...what good thing shall do that I may have eternal life?</strong>” This is the second red flag, this man thought you had to do good things to have eternal life, he just was wasn’t sure of what “good” thing he had to do and how much of it. <strong>Romans 3:20</strong> corrects our understanding by saying, “<strong>Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight...</strong>” He had a bag of what he called good, he was ready to go into his bag of what he called good things the moment Jesus would tell him of what they were.\r\n\r\nYou may be reading this devo and you are not saved or soundly saved and like the rich young ruler, you have a wrong understanding of who Jesus is, or you may be thinking that you have good things to be saved. You may want to hear what these good things are so that you can pull them out of your bag. We'll find out how Jesus dealt with his potential convert. To continue., blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Matthew 19:16-22, “16 Now behold, one came and said to Him, “Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?” 17 So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”</strong>\n\nIt’s an interesting conversation going on between Jesus and the rich young ruler and I love the manner in which Jesus asks questions. He answered him with a question, “<strong>Why do you call me good?”</strong> I believe Jesus wanted to challenge this man to see far beyond the natural Man, to a supernatural God. He was no ordinary Man and could not be in the same level with this man to be called good. If he called Him good, was he refereeing to Jesus as God? Jesus response, “<strong>there is none good but God</strong>” and Jesus was God therefore He was good.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nNow watch what Jesus does with his potential convert, he does not tell him to repeat sinners prayer to be saved, or even tell him about Himself of how He was going to die on the cross for his sins, no He goes about to establish was is considered “good” and how to have eternal life. He says, <strong>vs. 17, “…but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments”. </strong>It’s my humble opinion that Jesus was trying to strip this man of his self-righteousness ultimately that he will see his need for a Savior. The first thing He told him, keep the commandments to have eternal life. Upon hearing this, this man should have said, I’m unable to keep the commandments that are summed up in loving the Lord with all your heart and soul, and loving your neighbors as much as you love yourself. But as I mentioned before, he came with his bag of good things if asked, he was ready to produce. Jesus told him to keep the commandments and he asked, which ones. Brilliant Jesus first gave him 5 horizontal commandments, commandments in relation to men, loving his neighbor as much as himself, shall not murder, commit adultery, steal, lie, honor etc. Out of his bag of good things, he said in <strong>vs. 20, “…all these things I have kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?”. </strong>If this is what it took to have eternal life, he had just passed the test, but to keep the commandments, you had to keep all of them. James tells us “<strong>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend it in one point, he is guilty of all”, James 2:10</strong>. if you have a new flower vase, it’s perfect. If you drop it and has even a little crack, you’ve shattered it’s perfection. <strong>Psalm 19:7, “the law of the Lord is perfect…” </strong>To break one commandment is to break them all for you’ve shattered it’s perfection. And those who want to enter heaven by being “good” have to be perfect. And here is something to chew on, if I have six good eggs to make an omelet for my guests and I have one bad egg, one bad egg is enough to ruin the other six correct?\n\nJesus sees that this man is determined to have eternal life through the commandments, he has passed the first test (but not according to the sermon on the mount) so he asks, \"<b>what else do I lack</b>\", then <strong>Vs. 21, “Jesus said to him, if you will be perfect, go and sell what you have, and give money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me”</strong> Here is where the rubber meets the road, He told of him of perfection. He took him to the basis of the first 4 commandments (he had his riches as his god, his riches were his idol, took the name of the Lord in vain (failed to Honor Him as God), he had no time kept a side to worship God. What he trusted in was not good enough to save him. He had his five good eggs (commandments kept) and four bad eggs (commandments broken). One bad egg was enough to contaminate the rest, he had 4. This should have been enough for him to abandon all he trusted in and look to Jesus the perfect Lamb to save him.\n\nWhat are you trusting on to save you on judgment day? the bible says<strong> “It’s appointed unto men once to die and after this, but after this judgment”, Hebrews 9:27. Therefore, what you and I need is not to keep the laws to be saved unless we keep it perfectly, we need a perfect law giver who has kept it all to be a substitute for us.</strong>\n\nWhat God commands in the LAW (commandments) is perfection He has provided in the Gospel, GRACE. Christ satisfied the demands of the Law for us that we might become the righteousness of God. The Law giver was the Law keeper and the Law satisfier for the Law breakers.\n\nThe right use of the law like Jesus did prepares men for grace, it reveals the righteousness of God to convince men that God is good and they are bad. This leads to conviction that leads to repentance that leads to salvation (faith). <strong>Conviction</strong> is when a sinner takes sides with God against himself. He truly sees himself as a law breaker, deserving God’s wrath. He sees that he deserves hell because of God’s justice and with one voice he cries out, \"what must I do then to be saved\", <strong>John 16:8.</strong>\n\nConviction leads to repentance. <strong>Repentance</strong> is when a sinner takes all his so called assets (good things) from his asset column and sets them on liability column and forsakes them. This is a change of heart and direction, declaring bankrupt, done with self so as to be filled with Him, <strong>Matthew 19:23-26</strong>.\n\nRepentance leads to justification (salvation), Justification is what God does FOR us, Sanctification is what God does IN us. Justification means saved from the PENALTY of sin, from the demands of the law (God’s wrath), in other words declared not guilty when one repents. <strong>Romans 3:24-26, “ being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, 26 to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be JUST and the JUSTIFIER of the one who has faith in Jesus”</strong>\n\nIt’s impossible for a patient to accept heart transplant unless he is fully convinced of his need for it. Therefore the law is the scalpel a surgeon’s assistant (believers) put in the hands of the surgeon (Holy Spirit) to perform a heart surgery in order to take away the heart of stone (rebellion) and give him a heart of flesh (repentance and obedience) and then the gospel (God’s pill), good news comes to heal him (salvation).

              "<strong>Isaiah 41:15, \"Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make thee hills of chaff\"</strong>\r\n\r\nLife is full of up and downs, a lot of challenges to go with it. There are days you feel like you are winning and there are days when you feel like a failure. Often times I have used the word \"<strong>season modes</strong>\" for every season presents it's weather and everyone has to learn to adapt in every season otherwise you become a victim. At times even the preachers go dry, and they are left with no power and no strength to fight the good fight of a soldier. If the preachers, pastors, deacons, board members, evangelists are not exempt from the dry and burnouts. God may take you through a process and when you think you now have everything in place to make you perfect, He will relocate you again for <strong>His purpose is not to make you confident in yourself but confident in Him.</strong><!--more-->\r\n\r\nWe are all instrument of a kind designed and made by God. Each instrument has been made for a specific purpose to accomplish what it was designed to do. Let's look at some other words for “instruments”,<strong> a tool, device, gadget, utensil, apparatus, appliance</strong>. Let me take the word tool and make use of it. Any tool that need sharpening needs it before it can effectively be used. A sharpened tool will give you a better result compared to a blunt tool. Not only will a sharp tool give you a better result, it will make the work faster and easier and less energy will be required to have the job done. You can not force a lawn mower to trim the fence, it was never designed for that. Each and every tool was designed for a specific task and so is with every believer, we are designed for specific tasks, callings and ministries and we cannot go around trying to do everything that we were never called to do. I was never called to sing, therefore I don't need to appear at a choir practice for I will mess up everything. When you know what you have been called to do, you will not just have a passion for it but you will also be good at it. God has invested in each of us diversified gifts to be utilized for we are His instrument but...\r\n\r\nEvery instrument used at times get out of place, and has to be tuned, sharpened, oiled, repaired and the like and the Lord is saying to us in <strong>Isaiah 41:15, \"Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth\". </strong>\"Behold\", not only is He telling you and I to observe, watch, see, take a look at, view but He is also telling those around us to watch. You can be effective, but there comes a time when your effectiveness reduces and you have to come back to the one who is using you as the tool for sharpening. Watch the way He puts it, <strong>\"I will make thee\", </strong>If He does not do it, it cannot be done; if He does not fix it, it cannot be fixed, therefore we call on Him to sharpen our lives when we go blunt. I just checked and another word for blunt is dull. Blunt tools don't look attractive and most of the time, they have dents on the blade and are rusty. When you begin to sharpen it, expect it to sparkle. All the dents will diminish, it will shine and the owner of the tool will be happy about using a sharpened tool again. He is sharpening it because He wants to use it and not put in display.\r\n\r\nOur prayer lives, witnessing skills, reading of the word, faith, hope, working skills, wisdom, passions, dreams, desires, relationships need to be sharpened. Those reading have tools designed by God that have become dull, dormant, rusty and blunt. Someone looks like an old, beaten tool that has been abused in the hands of the wrong person. You've lost your effectiveness, you've tried hard to be used but because you are blunt, more energy is used to make something out of it. <strong>The sign of the anointing is when you can take less and do much with it</strong>, Holy Ghost knows how to sharpen us and put us back to work. Regardless of what size the tool is, when it's sharpened and used in the right field in which it was designed for, watch and you will see marvelous results. He says again in <strong>Isaiah 41:15, \"... thou shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make thee hills of chaff\". </strong>What a description of what will happen when you and I are sharpened, for we will thresh the mountains and beat them small. Remember when David was sharpened, his mountain was Goliath and because he was sharp in the word of the Lord, he threshed his mountains when Saul who was blunt at this time and could not even lift up his head to say a word. We thank Him for His word is our sharpener. Where in your life have you gone blunt, mark that it's not beginning but you already had it before and it was effective at one point but in the process of time, you, the tool fell in wrong hands that abused you as a tool or you were in the right hand but you lost your effectiveness and now you are blunt and dull, you have dent's all over and anything you try to do is yielding less strength or no strength. Jump into the Lord's workshop and let Him sharpen you again. He wants to use you, but with you blunt, you will not be effective. Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 12:1&amp;2, \"...do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI struggle sometimes to know what the will of God is for my life is in certain situations. I have no problem knowing the general will of God for His children only when it boils down and narrowed down to my life then it becomes a struggle. Often times you hear the messages \"claim it and receive it\" then you go to the scriptures and find there is more to claim and receive it. I see more preparation because God would not want to give us something that is good for it only to destroy our lives. I have seen people blessed of God, when you look at the blessing, you could tell it was made possible by God 100% but then you see how that blessings become a stumbling block in their lives. I ask myself why? It is then that I reminded that God is in the business of <strong>forming before He can fill</strong>. Many want to be filled and insist on being filled without being formed and therefore become leaking vessels. Preparation is vital.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe word of God sets us up to know God's will and for us to know God's will, we start with <strong>Mathew 6:33</strong>, which says to us to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and ALL these things will be given to you as well. Does that mean that upon seeking the kingdom of God everything I desire will automatically be given? Not quiet, there is something about seeking the kingdom of God that changes YOU to know who He is and who you are in relation to Him. I remember when I was young we would not be quick to take the corn flour and make corn bread out of it. We had a sieve we used to sift the flour before using it. The interesting thing about the sieve, it let the good flour pass through as we shook it and retained little chunks, husks, little sand we missed seeing left in the sieve. The sieve separated what was acceptable and rejected.\r\n\r\nThis is true with the word of God, as you are seeking His kingdom first and His righteousness, what you are doing is setting your life in prayer and His word to be shaken to sift through what is acceptable. <strong>Proverbs 10:32, tells us \"The lips of the righteous know what is ACCEPTABLE</strong>\". How will you know what is acceptable if you are not sifted through prayer and His word?\r\n\r\nHad you not been sifted, you would have not known that things like pride, stinginess, un forgiveness, fear, doubt, anger to mention a few were lingering in your life and what you desired would be a stumbling block if given unless God first dealt with what was left in the sieve. Now I understand why some things I prayed for did not come to pass or were delayed, God did not want the blessing to be a stumbling block. I did not have a stronger character to support what He wanted to do. I did not let my life be sifted first. Had I been to the sieve first, I would have known what I needed God to work on my life first before asking what I desired of Him in line with His will for my life. I want to be formed first before I can be filled, I hope that is your prayer however we will not know until we have been in the sieve first. To continue, Blessings Ev"

              "<strong>Romans 12:1&amp;2, \"...do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God\".</strong>\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the last message, the sieve separates what is acceptable and rejected. Paul writing to the Romans starts in chapter 12 by saying <strong>\"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, ACCEPTABLE to God, ...\". </strong>Could it be that the Romans thought their lives in were in line with God? Like the flour that was not sifted, everything looked ok on the outside until the sieve revealed as we see Paul applying it here. He tells them to present their bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, the next thing is \"<strong>do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and ACCEPTABLE and perfect will of God</strong>\". I keep emphasizing the word ACCEPTABLE because I see over and over in my life God exercising His will based on what is ACCEPTABLE. Paul takes the next three and half chapters teaching the Romans what is acceptable <strong>Romans 12, 13, 14, 15:1-8</strong>. This would mean, all these would pass through the sieve because they are acceptable to God.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nPeople tend to have their own definition of what is acceptable, the Word of God should be our source of knowing. Here is where what we are now asking, we are asking within the boundaries of what is acceptable. In re reading <strong>Romans 12:2,</strong> towards the end of the verse it says, <strong>\"…that you may prove what is that good and acceptable…</strong>\", we have done that based on His word, here comes what I think is hard to grasp <strong>\"… and PERFECT WILL of God</strong>\". Not sure who else has gone through this where you thought you were in God's perfect will on a given thing only to discover later you were not. It appeared spiritual yet it was carnal, you may have thought you heard from the Lord only to find that you missed it. It troubles me sometimes but then I get comfort knowing that God is working in me based on what is acceptable while directing my paths and yours. He is working in you, <strong>Philippians 2:13, \"for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure</strong>\", He is directing you <strong>Proverbs 3:6, \"In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths</strong>\", He is ordering your steps, \"<strong>Psalm 37:23, \"The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD, And He delights in his way. </strong>\r\n\r\nThe more we walk with the Lord, the more we learn, the more we grow, the more we are transformed, the more we operate in His will. At times it may not be clear right away what His will is for our lives but as we go through the sieve, we are sifted to know what is acceptable and we pray for God's will and direction within the boundaries of His word. We are no longer just praying for anything because it's our desire, we pray “<strong>thy will be done”.</strong> As we pray and get in the word, the more we are changed, the more the sieve reveals stumbling blocks, impurities in our character. I believe that we can know God's perfect will for our lives because we know what it takes. David says, <strong>Psalm 139, \"23 Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me, and know my anxieties; 24 And see if there is any wicked way in me, And lead me in the way everlasting\"</strong>. To be in God's will, he had wanted to be tried in the sieve something we all should strive for. Blessings Ev."

              "<strong>Luke 15:11-31, vs. 29-30, “29 So he answered and said to his father, \"Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends. 30, But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.'</strong>\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to know that situations and circumstances bring out something you may have never known was in you. What might have not bothered me before, I now realize it does. These things are like little tools presented to diagnose and reveal the areas in our lives that need work. I am many times surprised by my flesh when something out of the ordinary comes and stirs up an attitude, critical spirit I deemed absent.<!--more-->\r\n\r\nThe prodigal son's brother encountered with a situation that brought out the ugly side of him he may have never known to be present. Of course he was the quiet one, always doing what was right before his father, worked with him, stood beside him, never disappointed his father. Here comes his little brother who took his portion of inheritance even before his father was dead which may have suggested that he wished his father was long dead so as to get his inheritance. He then goes to a far off land and squanders it all. In as much as his older brother was a hard worker, you will later realize that he had the spirit of I don't care. His father would always pray and watch for his son to come home, maybe the older brother was praying his brother would never come back. Finally the brother comes home and he is received well, given the best robe, a feast thrown for him. The older brother does not even call him \"my brother\" but \"this your son\". He received all the blessing yet he messed up. Remember the person who became a believer appeared at your church, he was received well, everyone loved on him, they offered to invite him to their homes. Before long, everyone wanted him to be involved in their ministry, later met someone to marry before you. You saw them excel however looking at your life you felt the Lord was not fair. \"<em>Lord I have walked with you all these years, worked for you faithfully, tried my best to live a life pleasing to you and someone else comes in who has not walked with you that long and has all these blessings?</em>\".\r\n\r\nA little attitude is enough to derail you from the plans the Father has for you. All the older son needed to remember was that all the wealth his Father had was his also. You may be envying someone, even try to frustrate them, you feel neglected or left out when you feel that someone who does not deserve the kind of treatment they are receiving right now are receiving it. You ask yourself, \"<em>Why can't I be happy for them?”</em> To be in the big brother's shoes, though it's hard to deal with a situation like this, if anything, I should thank God for allowing a situation like this to bring out stinginess I need His work on, the uncaring spirit that was locked down in my heart, un-forgiveness, resentment, pride, not desiring one that has messed up to progress and rejoice over their progression. If you look at the story again, you can see that even the Father had something inside of him revealed, his unconditional love for his son. You could be a father so angry enough to want to choke your son but if you were walking down the street and saw people attacking your son, there will be that human instinct and love that overwhelms you not to continue walking away but run to his rescue. Who is that person God has sent your way to reveal something in you that God wants to deal with? It could be what is hindering you from getting where He wants to take you. Your complete healing and restoration depends on the surgery He does to remove the cancerous growth. <strong>Right diagnosis preps you up for the right cure</strong>. The prodigal son in your life is not an enemy but a friend God is using to bring out what is inside that the Lord may work on it.

              "<strong>Psalm 51:10-13, \"Create in me a clean heart O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not a way from Your presence; and take not Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. And I will teach transgressors your ways; and sinners will be converted unto thee.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nLiving a depressed life is living a defeated life. Depression is a killer. It builds up from very tiny thoughts of hopelessness and helplessness. Satan will from time to time want you to be depressed. And when you are depressed, you lose energy, and enthusiasm for living. Life becomes very meaningless and sometimes you may feel worthless and see no purpose for living. <!--more-->That why some people who have severe depression, in some cases, become suicidal. They take away their life. You may not consider doing that, but you equally could die from within suddenly or gradually. This may be evidenced by sudden disappearance of the joy of your salvation, and unwillingness to do anything or seek help. You may also be withdrawn from brethren and even stop going to church or stop reading and enjoying your fellowship with God in His word as you used to do. There may be a lot more changes in your behavior and lifestyle that depression will trigger.\r\n\r\nDo you remember David? I mean the famous David mentioned in the Bible? What do you remember about him? Well most of us remember him as a giant killer. He slew Goliath, the giant that haunted Israel for so long and he became one of the most celebrated young warriors in Israel. He was strong and courageous. Above all, he trusted in the Lord. He overcame Goliath by the name of the Lord. And he had great victory where a whole nation had failed. He made Israel fly in the air. The experience left him feeling elated and buoyant. Victory surrounded him. He was full of confidence and hope for greater things in the future. He didn't think that there was anything that could put him down, especially after slaying a giant. Dwarfs were nothing. David, perhaps, thought he could conquer anything. And, sure, he could. But that turned not to be the case. At one point, after being conquered by his own uncontrolled lust, which led him to have sex with Uriah's wife, he was knocked down so hard by the spirit of guilt and depression, he could not get up. He tried to hide the sin and weakness but without success, He also tried to deny that he was degenerating and dying from the inside with fear, guilt and shame, but only made his situation worse. <strong>You see cover up and self-denial cannot change facts. Denial is a kin to defeat.</strong> <strong>And cover up and pretense can only take you so far.</strong> When the time is mature, whatever was denied and covered up will resurrect with such force and power, capable of ruining your life forever and separating you from God. David almost ruined himself forever, but he did what you and I need to do every time we feel like losing it. He cried out to God for help-for <strong>“with God, nothing shall be impossible (Luke 1:37). </strong>\r\n\r\nComing to God, in prayer, with a broken and contrite spirit, he cried and pleaded with God in <strong>Psalm 51: 10-13: Create in me a clean heart O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not a way from Your presence; and take not Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. And I will teach transgressors your ways; and sinners will be converted unto thee.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Conquering something great in life does no guarantee victory over everything in life: but conquering everything in life, with God's help does.</strong>\r\n\r\nAnybody can fail or fall into deep pits, where you may be tempted to believe you will never get out. Well, I have news for you, if you fall deep into the pit of depression, or hopelessness because of any circumstance, get up! God has made provision for rising up. He understands that sometimes, we will feel awful and hurt badly. That is why He says, \"A RIGHTEOUS MAN FALLS SEVEN TIMES, AND RISES UP AGAIN\". You too can rise up today. Blessings, Boaz"

              "<strong>Matthew 4:1-11, “1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 2 And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry”</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6192\" src=\"https://magnifyhisword.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image.jpg\" alt=\"image\" width=\"236\" height=\"236\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\nThere is a subtle move of Satan operating in the Christian circles derailing believers from seeking what is most important to seeking what is temporal. And what is appearing to be the move of God having been wrapped up with a distortion of God’s word is causing many believers to drift from the path they ought to be in.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->The bible says, <strong>Luke 4:1-2, “1 Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 2 being tempted for forty days by the devil”.</strong> Jesus being filled with the Holy Spirit did not make Him less of a target of the devil, if anything it intensified the drive to derail Him from His call and be disobedient to the Father. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights <strong>he was hungry</strong>. A forty days' fast was accomplished by Moses (<strong>Exodus 34:28</strong>; <strong>Deuteronomy 9:18</strong>), and by Elijah (<strong>1Kings 19:8</strong>), and it is a significant fact in this connection that these two men appeared with Christ at His transfiguration (<strong>Matthew 17:3</strong>).\r\n\r\nOn this account, Jesus was tempted on three levels, three levels I believe we are tempted with as believers in very subtle ways appearing to be of God when it’s not. The subtle here are <strong>the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes and the pride of life</strong> also stated <strong>as the flesh, the world and the devil</strong>. When we are at our vulnerable state that’s when he strikes but again in very subtle ways. In this series, I break each temptation and how it presents itself to believers.\r\n\r\nFirst temptation: <strong>Vs. 3, “Now when the tempter came to Him, he said, \"If You are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.\" </strong>What we see here is the challenge to relationship which according to Satan (appearing as man or angel) equates believers relationship to God based on what they have or should have. He says “<strong>IF You are the Son of God…”</strong> Have you not heard numerous preachers say, <em>“if you are the son of God, you can never be hungry, sick, poor etc.</em>” If you are suffering from any of these, probably you are not a son or your sins or lack of faith is the reason you don’t have them. While this  message is popular, it is a temptation that appeals to the present appetite, the impulse of the moment, as many of our temptations do, and its very favorite with the poor, the lacking, and the needy. This what the prosperity gospel thrives on, health and wealth. And what Satan suggests to them is that if they were really the beloved objects of God's care, their condition would be otherwise. This paints a picture of the believer being the center of God’s plan rather than Christ.\r\n\r\nBecause the relationship of a believer is questioned on the basis of what we have or don’t have, we find that we neglect what is most important and spend more time chasing ways to \"command these stones to become bread\". We run around binding, claiming to receive, in other words blub and grab and we neglect <strong>Matthew 6:33</strong>. It’s not that these things God will not do if we need them, it’s the order of priority that is the issue.\r\n\r\n<strong>In response to this temptation, Jesus appealed to the Authority of the word with <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">understanding</span> and <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">clarity</span></strong>, vs.“<strong>4 But He answered and said, \"It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'\"</strong> In His hour of trial He did not look to visions or voices or special revelation for guidance, He used the written Word as the lamp for His feet (<strong>Psalms 119:105</strong>) in response to the will of the Father. In the conflict of temptation He did not defend Himself by His own divine wisdom, but used that wisdom which God had revealed to all Israel through His prophets. <strong>Jesus used the Scripture as of final, argument-ending authority</strong>. We could have no higher endorsement of the Old Testament than this use of it by Christ. It was sufficient for Him in His temptations, and with the addition of the New Testament, it is sufficient for us in all things.\r\n\r\nSatan’s mission is to make you doubt the word of God and appeal to emotions, steps, plans to satisfy an appetite he knows you crave for so that the Word becomes secondary if it must be used. He also distorts the word through self-deception and the use of other people to make the word of God sound something else and to take us off the path. Our hope is the WORD because it is SUFFICIENT when rightly UNDERSTOOD and rightly APPLIED. <strong>“3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. 4 For the weapons (Word) of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ”, 2Corinthians 10:3-5. </strong>To continue, blessings, Ev"

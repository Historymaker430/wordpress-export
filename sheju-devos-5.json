Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land&#8221; 1 Sam 28:3<\/p>\n<p>In this passage Prophet Samuel, who represented God\u2019s voice, was dead.  Saul had no communication with God because of his disobedience which will be seen shortly.  It was similar to a soldier losing radio contact with their commanding officer at headquarters during a war.  Everyone mourned over Samuel\u2019s death as he was a great man of God, having served the Lord so faithfully since he was a young boy.  I would hope to make such an impact for my God should He tarry that people would mourn over my death because I faithfully and unashamedly carried the truth of God\u2019s Word to all.<\/p>\n<p> Look what Saul had done, he put away (cleansed) the mediums, and spiritists (witches) out of the land.  The Message Bible says &#8220;Saul had long since cleansed out all those who held s\u00e9ances with the dead&#8221;  Good job Saul.  But Saul was quickly about to face a battle against the Philistines that when &#8220;Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart&#8221;  This king was terrified, what did he do, he sought the King of Kings, God.<\/p>\n<p> Verse 5 shows the result which reads, &#8220;He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets&#8221; God didn\u2019t answer Saul, why?  Verse 17-19 tells of the reason, and the bottom line again was his disobedience.  God had ripped the kingdom off Saul\u2019s hand and had given it to David.  How did Saul find this out, through consulting Samuel?  What I thought Samuel was dead.  Oh yes, but Saul contacted the dead through one who contacted the dead regularly, named the Witch of Endor.<\/p>\n<p> The very thing that Saul did away with, expelling the mediums and spiritists from the land, was the very thing he ran to when the battle came.  He turned to the Devil\u2019s servant and the Devil\u2019s ways for the answer.  Does that sound familiar to you?  I feel like there has been times that I\u2019ve thrown something away spiritually, only to go &#8220;digging through the garbage&#8221; to find it again.  It could be pride, bitterness, lust, greed, envy, Unforgiveness, etc.   The bottom line was it was in the garbage because it belonged there! Spiritually it is like Proverbs 26:11 states, &#8220;As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly&#8221;  I have at times unfortunately turned to ungodly things as if that was going to help me in a battle.  It only made things worse, and ungodly things can NEVER produce godly results and victory.  If God turned a deaf ear to me because of sin, I need to repent and let the Holy Spirit break me, humble me, and mold me into putty in the hands of God.  Whether I am a prince or a pauper I need God\u2019s favor and communication with my Father. Many times we can throw out the paraphernalia of sin such as ungodly books, magazines, CD\u2019s, notes, pictures, etc., but it needs to be removed from the place that it is hidden most, in our minds and hearts.  Romans 12:2, speaks about being &#8220;transformed by the renewing of your mind,\u201d and that is what we need&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Application: Lord, help me not be a garbage picker or a dog that returns to its vomit.  When I face life\u2019s battles let me turn to You and Your Word which is truth as ammunition to fight against the enemy.  Keep my life humble before you and may I sense at any time when my sweet communion with You is melting away.  Keep me humble for You resist the proud but give grace to the humble. Amen.

Jn 21:5 He called out to them, \u201cFriends, haven\u2019t you any fish?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d they answered. Jn 21:6 He said, \u201cThrow your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\u201d When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.<\/p>\n<p> Anyone can do a job or task for a little while, but to do it daily and consistently now there\u2019s a challenge.  When Jesus first started to call his disciples he interrupted their lives and he called the two sets of brothers and would make them fishers of men.  <\/p>\n<p>In John 21, Jesus was standing on the shore, his disciples not realizing it was Him, and called out to them \u201cFriends, haven\u2019t you any fish?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d they answered. Jn 21:6 He said, \u201cThrow your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\u201d The result was the following, \u201cWhen they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.  They did it Jesus\u2019 way and it yielded fish, because of their obedience.  Again in Luke 5 we read another fish story account.  Jesus told these men who were fishing all night, \u201cPut out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.\u201d  Simon Peter replied by saying, \u201cMaster, we\u2019ve worked hard all night and haven\u2019t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.\u201d  Simon could have argued with the notion that Jesus knew nothing about fishing since He Himself was a carpenter.  But Peter obeyed because it was Jesus speaking.   The outcome of that obedience was that<\/p>\n<p>\u201dWhen they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.\u201d  They caught fish because they did it Jesus\u2019 way, not theirs.\u201d Again they obeyed and caught fish.  \u201cWhen Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus\u2019 knees and said, \u201cGo away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!\u201d 9 For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, 10 and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon\u2019s partners.  Then Jesus said to Simon, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid; from now on you will catch men.\u201d 11 So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.  We know that Jesus said 19 \u201cCome, follow me,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cand I will make you fishers of men.\u201d  Jesus wants His fishers of men to fish His way.  Hab 1:14 says, \u201cYou have made men like fish in the sea, like sea creatures that have no ruler.\u201d  Hos 4:3 states, \u201c\u2026Hos 4:3 \u2026the fish of the sea are dying.\u201d  Isa 50:2 When I came, why was there no one?  When I called, why was there no one to answer?   Was my arm too short to ransom you?  Do I lack the strength to rescue you?  By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert; their fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst.<\/p>\n<p>The fish need to be fished for and be caught if they are to be saved.  Yet we are fishing for men (people), and with that mandate seems to bring fear and possible disillusionment.  Yet \u201cWe are called to be fishers of men (Matt. 4:19).  \u201cProgram your mind into the mode that the fish God wants you to catch are upstream.  To get them you will have to go against the current of self-will.  Waves of fear and discouragement will thrust against you, but use the muscle the Spirit of God has put within you to fight against the tide.\u201d  (Ray Comfort)<br \/><br style=\"font-weight:bold;\" \/><span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Application:<\/span><br \/>1.

How sad though, that such a mindset has swept up the church, to the degree that many of today\u2019s big name TV preachers tell the deceived masses that monetary gain is God\u2019 s plan for them, and the surest sign of his blessing. Falsehood and lies I say. Look to our Lord, he had nowhere to lay His head, are we greater than Him? Here the inspired apostle pens the words of the glorified Christ, true counsel from Jesus\u2019 heart. Here He gives us three things of value, three things that will truly enrich the life that is earnestly seeking after God. These are worth more than all this worlds riches combined.<\/p>\n<p>1.) He counsels us to buy from Him gold, refined in the fire. This gold is the true, intimate knowledge of God known by all who would abandon themselves and seek Him in truth, true spiritual wealth, for the one who knows God is truly rich, not in the ways of this world which is passing away, but in eternal ways, those which shall last for eternity. The refining is the burning away of every desire but Him, all of our self-seeking, all of our asking of Him to gain for ourselves, instead of out of a humble desire and love for God.<\/p>\n<p>2.) Next He counsels us to buy from Him white garments. Here is the true proof of a Christian, a holy heart and life. These are the pure garments of holiness, unspotted from the world, that every Christian is to be clothed with, for it is commanded of our God (I Peter 1:15-16) and it is required to enter Heaven\u2019s gates, for without holiness we shall not see the Lord (Hebrews 12:14). We must be clothed in the wedding garments. The life of a Christian is marked by ongoing faith and obedience, for He that is truly born of God does not sin (has no sin as an option) (I John 5:18). The life of sin has been abandoned, we now pursue a life of holiness.<\/p>\n<p>3.) Lastly He counsels us to buy form Him eye salve, that we may see, true spiritual illumination, that we may see our helpless state, and that we may bow our knee humbly before His majesty, in reverence and awe, surrendering our lives wholly to Him. We are either completely His, born of His spirit and dead to ourselves, or we are still under the sway of the evil one. We mustn\u2019t let human reason and philosophy draw us away from the truth of what God\u2019s word says.<\/p>\n<p>Now you may ask, how is it that I buy these precious gems of the Christian life, how do I obtain what it is Jesus is telling me to purchase? The price is our lives, our desires, our wills. Renouncing the world and ourselves, and offering our lives as a living sacrifice to God Almighty, that He might do with us as He pleases. Our wills must be as His will, and He alone must be our desire. We must be willing to sell all to follow Him( Matt. 19:21). Then we will truly know Him, divine intimacy with the Lord of glory, Christ reining in our hearts, now and for all eternity.<\/p>\n<p>In the love and truth of Christ, and for His glory alone, blessings Brother Ben<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Revelation 3:18- I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.

Many of the suicides are due to hopelessness. Over one million people commit suicide every year. The World Health Organization estimates that it is the thirteenth-leading cause of death worldwide and the National Safety Council rates it sixth in the United States. It is a leading cause of death among teenagers and adults under 35. I discover more that there are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>In the midst of all these, I take comfort knowing that Hope keeps a man alive. As long as there is hope, regardless of what one has to go through, deal with and suffer, there will be something inside called hope propelling him or her to keep fighting till the end. The people, who have lost hope throw in the towel, call it a quit but the people who have hope, keep standing regardless of the time and season. Hope is being in the mode of expectation, anticipating, looking forward to. Hope is not about something that is uncertain, it\u2019s certain but not yet realized.<\/p>\n<p>Faith is the main thing that keeps hope alive. You hope for something that has not materialized yet and you can&#8217;t just stop thinking about it, talking about it, watching for it and waiting for it. In Luke 15, Jesus gives a parable of father who had two sons, we know the story is about the prodigal son. The younger son took away his in heritance and went to a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living. When he came to his senses after spending everything and had nothing left, he decided to go back home. Meanwhile his father had been hoping, praying, waiting, and watching to see his son coming home one day. Luke 15:20, &#8220;And he rose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him&#8221;. This father was not just passing by then saw his son, no, he had been hoping. For that reason he could not go into depression and fear could not keep him down for hope was keeping him alive and when what he hoped for arrived, he ran to receive his son. Hope will make you embrace promises, desires when they appear at a distance and when they appear, you will run to receive it.<\/p>\n<p>A person who is hoping has themselves at rest, Psalm 16:9, &#8220;Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh shall rest in hope&#8221;. There is nothing as bad as being in a restless position. People on hoping mode also do other things to keep hope alive, Psalm 71:14, &#8220;But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more&#8221;. One can be on the hoping mode but can also be complaining and checking the time when it will happen. As for the Psalmist he says that he will hope continually, daily, consistently and to keep his hope alive, he will yet praise Him more and more. The reason why praising Him while on the hoping mode is vital, it keeps fueling faith in you to trust Him even more and not give up.<\/p>\n<p>Colossians 1:28, &#8220;&#8230; Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221;. What a way to hope when the greatest one in in you. Christ in us gives us assurance that as we hope, He is there with us and will never leave us. When we are getting discouraged and feel like giving up, His words of comfort and hope will keep us alive and kicking to trust Him. Him ordering the steps and guiding us teaches us to hope in Him even more for if He brought us this far, He can take us that far. If He provided for us then, He will do it again. If He fought for us then, we hope that He will do it again. If He provided a job then, He will do it again. We Hope in Him all day long.<\/p>\n<p>Have you lost hope that you could get married, be in ministry, be used of Him, achieve your career or goal, become somebody or whatever it is? Don&#8217;t let hope die for He is in you, keep pumping it and living to the fullest, exercise things that will keep your hope alive and remember that Christ in you, the hope of glory, the hope of beauty, the hope of splendor, hope of magnificence, hope of wonder, hope of brilliance and many more.

God does not hide His reasons from us neither does He beat about the bush to tell us why. He is a jealous God therefore whatever He does, He does it that He may look good. Remember the bible says, \u201cHe will share His glory with no one\u201d?. See God blesses us in different ways that we may be a testimony of what He can do. He does it through us that people may know that He is able but what we fail many times to testify before people of what He has done. I believe one of the reasons why we feel we cannot testify is because we think people are going to feel that we are bragging or boasting through our testimony so we keep blessings to ourselves. I must admit that there are times I have felt this way and so I did not testify of His faithfulness.<\/p>\n<p>I believe with all my heart that the number one reason why God blesses us is not for us be comfortable with the blessing but to bring glory to His name and show people what He can do so that when they are in need they can also go before God and trust Him. It\u2019s good to be blessed and God loves to bless His children but when His children receive blessings and are quiet not testifying about them what happens?, there are no people who can tap into that reference that He is able. I would say, \u201cThis is sharing with Him His glory\u201d. If you are used to making Him look good before men, He has no problem loading you with more blessings.<\/p>\n<p>1 John 5:11, \u201cAnd this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son\u201d, John is giving us a testimony of what God has done, God giving us eternal life by Christ Jesus. He is making God look good. Go back to the old testament, we see many people like Abraham who were so much blessed, Moses makes God look good by testifying on behalf of Abraham. Solomon was blessed,  he testified of God blessings and so was David and many more. We can trust God today to bless us because, before we came the people before us trusted in Him, testified of His faithfulness and our response was, \u201cLord if you blessed them, you can bless us too, and if they testified of how you blessed them, we will testify of how you\u2019ve blessed men too\u201d. This morning, I ask you to make Him look good. Think about the things He has done, spiritually, materially, financially, health wise. Find someone and share your testimony with them, share with me. Despite of what I\u2019m trusting God for right now, I have so much God has done in my life, my marriage, ministry, job, and family I need to testify about. The testimony is not about me or you, the testimony is about Him. Let\u2019s make Him look good,. Praises looks good on Him..

They&#8217;ve learned to wait in the secret place of prayer allowing God to impart His heart to them. They&#8217;ve been people whose hearts have been passionate for the [same] things which God is passionate about.<\/p>\n<p>George Mueller began orphanages for children in Bristol during the 1899s. He trusted God to meet their every need. He never asked for money, but he clothed, housed and fed many thousands of children. Near the end of his life he said that every person for whom he had prayed to come to Christ (with the exception of two), had come to know Christ as his Savior. After Mueller died, those two people also came to a personal knowledge of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>David Brainard ministered among Indian tribes in the Northeastern part of the United States during the 1700s. It was said of him that the snow would melt underneath him because he prayed so long for the Indians. He was God&#8217;s instrument to bring many to the knowledge of the Savior.<\/p>\n<p>When our hearts beat in harmony with God\u2019s heart, He will do incredible things to bring to pass those things for which we have prayed. God\u2019s heart breaks for a lost and dying world. When our hearts feel the same burden, we will cry unto Him and He will hear and answer us. The Psalmist said, &#8220;Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy. He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him&#8221; (Ps. 126:5, 6 NIV).<\/p>\n<p>When a mother weeps for a rebellious son, it touches God\u2019s heart. When a father cries to God for His fallen children, it moves heaven to earth. When young people are broken over their schoolmates&#8217; salvation, the Spirit of God is released from heaven to capture that school for Christ. God holds dear to His heart the tears of His children.<\/p>\n<p>God has a bottle where He stores our tears; a book where He records our heartaches. As we weep for those who are without Christ, we must never forget that God has not forgotten. One day, in His time, He will open the heavens and pour out a blessing upon us that&#8217;s beyond imagination.<\/p>\n<p>A pastor recently told me when his church put in new carpet for their prayer room, he made a special request of the Lord. He said, &#8220;Oh God, I pray that this carpet will be dedicated to You by the tears of your people.&#8221; Not long afterwards, his prayers were answered. The church had a series of &#8220;revival meetings&#8221; with Life Action Ministries. God moved during those days, and the prayer room was filled with people weeping in brokenness and repentance over their sins.<\/p>\n<p>Tears touch the heart of God. He understands the hurts of humanity because He gave His own Son for those injured by their own sins. Perhaps the shortest and most powerful Scripture in the Bible is the one that simply says, &#8220;Jesus wept.&#8221; If God in human flesh wept, then we&#8217;ll also weep when we grasp His heart. If you find yourself weeping for the souls of man, remember God is storing your tears in a bottle. One day, He will open that bottle, and out of it will flow &#8220;rivers of living waters.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Application: What names are attached to the tears that God is bottling up on your behalf?

Whether you believe it or not, you are a target of the devil. Satan\u2019s goal is to oppose you and prevent you from being what God created you to be. He does not want you to reach your destiny in life. He hates your progress. Your prosperity intimidates him. Your ministry and service to God diminishes him to nothing. Your worship to God deprives him of what he longs for more than anything else. Your dreams of success in, for example, life, marriage, education, career, business, leadership, ministry, relationships, etc. gives the devil headache and he will do anything to hit back and stop you from succeeding God\u2019s way. He can even attempt to substitute God\u2019s plan and blessing with his own. His own may even look more attractive, appealing and rewarding, temporarily. But the truth of the matter is, &#8220;He comes to steal, kill, and destroy.&#8221; John 10:10). Satan can destroy you with a good thing just as much as he can destroy you with a bad thing. It does not matter to him what weapon he chooses from his arsenal. His goal is the same: conquer, destroy and kill you. What then should you do?<\/p>\n<p>Get ready to fight for your blessings and for your destiny like a real soldier. There is no handout without battle. You must move swiftly and violently toward possession of what is yours. If you don\u2019t, the devil will conquer you and you will miss the will of God. How can you be sure to conquer? What strategy can you use? What tools do you need?<\/p>\n<p>I want to recommend three things you must do in order to conquer any enemy anywhere at any time:<\/p>\n<p>1. Stand on the mountain top-God\u2019s mountain. Look for the solid Rock of Ages, the Lord Jesus Christ and stand on His promises. Stand on His will. Stand on His faithfulness. Stand on His power and presence etc. Where you stand is important. That is what gives you strength and balance. If you are not standing, you are falling. When Moses was faced with an enemy, the Am\u2019-a-lek, he went to the top of the hill (God\u2019s hill) to stand there before God. Listen to what he said: &#8220;tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.&#8221; Exodus 17:9<\/p>\n<p>2. Take the rod of God in your hand and raise it up. That is what Moses did. Today, you don\u2019t need a rod like that of Moses. The rod you need is the Word of God. Take the Bible in your hand and fill your heart and head with the Word. Meditate on it day and night. Apply what the Word says. Argue with the word in your mouth. Resist with the word. Reason with the word. Challenge with the word. Speak the Word. Our warfare largely involves &#8220;verbal exchange&#8221; with the enemy. Tell him &#8220;It is written&#8221;, then quote what is written. Satan fears the Word of God. He cannot argue with it. Because the word is truth, and he cannot handle truth.<\/p>\n<p>3. Have supporters to help you along the way. No matter how strong, independent, confident, competent and experienced you are whether as a leader, preacher, husband, wife, young man or woman, parent, etc. you will need somebody or people to stand with you when the battle is hot and prolonged and you can no longer keep your hands up on the hill with God\u2019s rod in your hand by yourself. Every one of us gets tired once in a while or often. We all need people in our lives who will love us, teach us, counsel us, encourage us or even rebukes and correct us so we can go the right direction. Without such people, and their invaluable support, we are bound to be defeated in the battle field. Moses knew the value of people and so brought a long with him to the top of the hill Aaron and Hur to support him. When his hands were up, Israel was winning. When his hands went down, because of tiredness, the enemy was winning. But when Aaron and Hur lifted up his hands, Israel prevailed. It took more than Moses, a great and experienced leader, to win his battle.<\/p>\n<p>What about you? Are you ready to fight and win? Sure you can if you can do what has been proven to give victory. Today, review the battles you have fought and those you are fighting now. If you lost a battle, ask yourself why? If you didn\u2019t fight right, rise up, pick up your weapons and fight to regain. Listen to God. Fight a good fight. And if you need help, don\u2019t shy to ask. Better ask for help than die in the battle field or loose what was meant to be your destiny. God will help you. Pray for wisdom, courage and obedience. God bless you and May He give you victory in all areas of your life. Amen!

Would you give it to the fierce warrior, or perhaps the brilliant scientist?  Maybe the military soldiers should be charged with so great a treasure.  <\/p>\n<p>Look at the ones that God entrusted to carry His great treasure.  He chose those who were frail, weak, fallible, and liable to sickness, persecution, and death.  One blow could put an end to those picked by God just as any other man.  Without the strength of the military bearing arms before them, they faithfully carry the gospel with the armor of God upon their lives, and the treasure within their lives. Yes God uses mere man to accomplish His great work, entrusting him with His great treasure, the gospel. <\/p>\n<p>The Jars of Clay (earthen vessels) are ordinary people that serve an extraordinary God.  God is the One that empowers the jars of clay. What can a jar of clay do, in and of itself?  It can only contain that which is placed inside.  And the only One that can place something inside is the One who formed the vessel of clay, the Potter.   Remember the account of Jeremiah with at the potter\u2019s house?  <\/p>\n<p>JER 18:1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 2 &#8220;Go down to the potter&#8217;s house, and there I will give you my message.&#8221; 3 So I went down to the potter&#8217;s house, and I saw him working at the wheel. 4 But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.JER 18:5 Then the word of the LORD came to me: 6 &#8220;O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter does?&#8221; declares the LORD. &#8220;Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.  <\/p>\n<p>The Potter was intent on forming the pot and fashioning it to His liking.  He had in mind a purpose for the pot.  For everything God forms is for God\u2019s purpose and everything God forms He fills.  When the earth was without form, God formed it and filled it with light, water, and life.  God formed the ark (Noah just followed the blueprints) and filled it with the animals and Noah\u2019s family.  God formed the tabernacle and the temple and filled them with furniture and His presence.  God\u2019s desire is that He can do with us as ordinary clay pots and fill us with the all-surpassing power of the everlasting gospel.  <\/p>\n<p>In the children\u2019s story the Tale of Three Trees each tree had a purpose for itself.  The first tree boasted that it&#8217;s lumber would be used to make a great and beautiful treasure chest. The chest would be decorated with bright golden hinges and polished to a fine and shiny finish. Inside it would hold great riches, jewels which were the colors of the rainbow and gold and silver coins. Now the first tree that had dreamed of being a beautiful treasure chest was instead made into a manger. It was sold to a farmer who used it in his cave where he kept and fed his animals. From this manger the animals of the farm ate the hay that lay in it. Until one night a young woman and her husband came to the cave looking for shelter for themselves and their newborn baby. In that manger, they laid their infant son. It was at that moment that the tree knew that it held the greatest treasure in the world, God&#8217;s gift to mankind. And as the child lay sleeping in the manger, the angels sang and the stars shone brightly in the sky.

From the moment Daniel and his friends are taken captive and exiled, they are required to immerse themselves in the language and literature of the Babylonians (1:4), with its focus on sorcery, astrology and polytheism.  This was an alien atmosphere and culture to these displaced Hebrew boys.<\/p>\n<p>Although they were in an ungodly, foreign land, this ungodly land was not in them.  They were in Babylon but not of it.  Daniel and his friends had their hearts resolved in Yahweh; therefore they refused to compromise with their actions.  Before a public victory comes, a private victory must take place within the heart.  This can clearly be seen in the life of these Hebrews as \u201cDaniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king\u2019s meat\u2026.\u201d  Daniels heart was set on Yahweh, his friends followed him in this desire as well, but now this desire certainly needed to be appropriated or fleshed out.  Daniel didn\u2019t just intend to keep himself pure for the Lord, he desired it.<\/p>\n<p>In his book A Heart Ablaze, John Bevere points out the difference between an intention and a desire, showing they are not the same thing.  Many have good and godly intentions, but when it comes time to implement that intention they don\u2019t follow through, because it may not have been their true desire.  He says, \u201cDesire is the path that a person will take, no matter how good his intentions may be.\u201d  James 1:14 reads, \u201cBut every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust (desire), and enticed.\u201d  This verse speaks about desire on the negative side.  Psalm 37:4 shows us the positive side, \u201cDelight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.\u201d  Both verses show the power of desire.  Our intentions are what we will do when it is convenient at the time, but our desires are what will drive us even when it\u2019s not convenient.<\/p>\n<p>Daniel\u2019s true desire was stated when the Scripture reads, \u201cBut Daniel purposed [desired] in his heart\u2026,\u201d because he acted upon that desire in a time that was inconvenient for him.  He made the request to the prince of the Eunuchs that he and his friends to be allowed to eat vegetables and water, and not be defiled by eating the king\u2019s meat.  Well at first the Eunuch didn\u2019t go along with it because if the king saw the Hebrews looking worse (downtrodden) than the other young men their age, then the king would have had the Eunuchs head.  However Daniel in his wisdom asked if perhaps the eunuch might allow them a test for only ten days to which it was agreed upon.  Daniel true desire was to please not the king of Babylon but the King of Kings, the Lord. <\/p>\n<p>Application:  May you have your private victory today, to face the public challenge when tempted to sin.

And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,\u201d Phil 3:20<\/p>\n<p>The US Department of Education has made educators aware of a new educational development called educating for citizenship.  Most people spend one-third of their lives as children and two-thirds of their lives as adults.  Educators are being instructed to educate children in respect to being not just adults, but furthermore viable and model citizens that serve their country well. According to the dictionary, a citizen is a person owing loyalty to and entitled by birth or naturalization to the protection of a state or nation.  Another definition reads that a citizen is a resident of a city or town especially one entitled to vote and enjoy other privileges there.<\/p>\n<p>The following is from the US Department of Ed. Website: Citizenship and Patriotism<\/p>\n<p>Citizenship requires doing our share for our community and our country. Being a good citizen means caring about the good of society and participating actively to make things better.   Research reveals that participating in community service programs and learning about the importance and value of serving others can be a powerful influence on positive character development.  Patriotism is an important part of good citizenship. Patriotism is love of and loyalty to our country. It involves honoring the democratic ideals on which the country is based and expecting elected officials to do the same, respecting and obeying its laws and honoring its flag and other symbols. It also involves accepting the responsibilities of good citizenship, such as keeping informed about national issues, voting, volunteering<\/p>\n<p>Christians have dual citizenship.  That is to say they are a citizen of their country, USA, India, China, etc\u2026, as well as a citizen in heaven.  And just as most people will spend more time on the other side, the adult side of their lives as citizens so we too as Christians will spend more time on the other side, eternity!  WOW, I was awed talking with a friend about the incredible parallel spiritual truth that we discovered while talking about education America can call themselves an American because some are aliens, outsiders, so not all that call themselves Christians are citizens of God\u2019s Kingdom of heaven.    There is such a thing as a false convert, but I will save that topic for another day.  Spring boarding off definition of citizen, Christians have been born again and owe loyalty to their country (heaven), because they have been bought with a price (1 Cor. 6:20).  The Apostle Paul reminds us that we have citizenship in heaven, and thus are entitled to the protection, rights, and privileges of that country.  All I can think of is healing, salvation, power in the Holy Spirit, wisdom, spiritual gifts.  The old clich\u00e9 says of some that \u201csome are so heavenly minded that they are no earthly good.\u201d God sent us the perfect model citizen that was so heavenly minded and extremely earthly good simultaneously, and His name is JESUS (Jn. 13:15).   Peter tells us, Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul. Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us (1 Pt. 2:11-12).\u201d  Are you living as a citizen of your earthly country and your Heavenly home?  Remember where you will spend not two &#8211; thirds of your life, but you are living your eternal life right not, just waiting for the day He takes us home<\/p>\n<p>Application:  Ask yourself, the Lord and other Christians if they feel you are living as a good citizen of heaven.  Allow them to tell you what you need to hear not just what you want to hear.

The shepherd that provides the salt is the same that leads to the water.<\/p>\n<p>We see this with Zacchaeus, the bible says, \u201c4 So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way\u201d. Those who sincerely desire a sight of Christ, like Zacchaeus, will break through opposition, and take pains to see him. They are hungry and thirsty for something bigger than what they have acquired. We see this also with Paul in Philippians 3:7, who said, \u201c7 But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. 8 Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If Christ is seeking the unbeliever, He will put new desires in them. Read Ezekiel 36: 26, \u201c I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them\u201d, John 6:44, \u201c No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jesus had just said how hard it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God, here we see Him seek a tax collector who is an outcast and rich to save him. Christ guides by his grace those who seem to be furthest from it, He is the seeker.  Vs., 5 And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, \u201cZacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.\u201d 6 So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully\u201d. In the midst of that great crowd, He knew Zacchaeus and called him by name. What a strange mixture of passions must Zacchaeus have now felt, hearing one speak, as knowing both his name and his heart and would give him attention despite of who he was. Knowing he did not deserve anything, Christ invited himself to his house as his guest and he received Him joyfully. I\u2019m glad that salvation is the best decision Christ ever made for me. He sought me and bought me with his redeeming blood. He came to dwell in a heart He had prepared.<\/p>\n<p>Wherever Christ comes He opens the heart, and inclines it to receive Him. He that has a mind to know Christ, shall be known of Him. Those whom Christ calls, must humble themselves, and come down. We may well receive him joyfully, who brings all good with him.

Not long  after, we see Jesus encountering with a rich young ruler (very proud)  who went away sad when Jesus talked to him about the first commandment  when he said, &#8220;.Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me&#8221; Luke 18:22.  Upon leaving, Jesus says in the presence of His disciples, &#8220;18:24 .&#8221;How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God! 25 For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than  for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&#8221; The disciples became puzzled by this statement to which they followed with a question,  &#8220;Who then can be saved? Vs. 26, I love Jesus answer because it is the heartbeat of the gospel,  27 But He said, &#8220;The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Luke 19:2, \u201cNow behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich&#8221;.  Known from a single incident in the Gospel of Luke in which he became a follower of Jesus,  Zacchaeus was a rich a tax collector under the  Romans. He lived in Jericho, a customs station on a major trade route.  Because of the way he had gained his wealth, townspeople viewed him as a man who was a sinner vs7. Publicans to which he was were considered  sinners. It\u2019s shocking to know that the name Zacchaeus means pure or  righteous, something he was not when Jesus met him.<\/p>\n<p>We are told, 3 And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature. 4 So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way &#8220;. I\u2019m curious to know how Zacchaeus knew about Jesus, perhaps from  Mathew encountering with Jesus in Mathew 9. Matthew was met by Christ  the seeker of him. Matthew then throws a party for Jesus and invites  other tax collectors. Though we are not told of Zacchaeus, could it be  that he was present and something Jesus said captured his heart and  wanted to see more of this man. Or the other thing to speculate, he may  have missed the party and having heard others talk about this amazing  Man\/God who was willing to hang out with the outcast considered sinners, he couldn\u2019t wait to see Him.<\/p>\n<p>He sought diligently, despite obstacles due to his limitations, he ran a  head and climbed up a tree to see Him. Those who sincerely desire a  sight of Christ, like Zacchaeus, will break through opposition, and take pains to see him.<\/p>\n<p>Zacchaeus appears to be the seeker, the truth of the matter is, and Christ is the seeker of those lost. Going back to Luke 18, the parable he gives  perfectly fits the rich young ruler and Zacchaeus. Jesus already knew of these two as we read in the parable and He was about to demonstrate  something to qualify His statement when He said, Luke 18:24  .&#8221;How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!  25 For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than  for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God 27 But He said, &#8220;The things which are impossible with men are possible with God\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Salvation is impossible with man but not with God and we will see that in this  devotion. This is why I say many times, salvation cannot be manipulated, and no amount of prayers or even sinner\u2019s prayer can save a person, not even the scripture verse. All these may instruct someone to the Savior  but have no ability of their own to save. Psalm 3:8, \u201cSalvation belongs to the Lord\u201d It begins with Jesus the seeker and an end with Jesus the Savior and in between there is the sought that has God given desire to seek Him.

I tried to define it but could not come up with a concrete definition. The dictionary would not give me a concrete answer either. There were some ideas suggesting what is good yet it would not pin point exactly what it is. What one group consider good may not be necessarily good to another group. What one generation embraces as good, may not be embraced by another generation. Do you have a definition of the word &#8220;Good&#8221;? can you share it with me?<\/p>\n<p>Since I would not define good, I asked myself, then what do I consider good? Still no answer, then moved to this question, what is the standard of goodness? I wanted to answer it but asked myself another question, who sets the standard? I think I have used this analogy before, of a little girl looking at a white sheep and  thinking how nice and clean the sheep looked until it began to snow,. At that moment she thought the sheep did not look as clean as she thought compared to the snow; Same sheep, different background.. Here was another question I asked myself I was exploring what &#8220;good is&#8221;, what are the requirements for something or someone to be good? I&#8217;m I good person? Does doing something good make someone a good person?<\/p>\n<p>In the past I have asked different people if they considered themselves good and 90% said yes. I don&#8217;t know about you but I don&#8217;t consider myself a good person at all. I try to do good things to people but never see myself as good because I know I have issues. Imagine you have guests, you decide to make them an omelet, you have 6 fresh good eggs and 3 bad eggs I don\u2019t think you would mixt the good eggs and the bad and present your omelet to your guests would you? The three bad eggs are enough to ruin the other six-by the way you only need 1 bad one to ruin all. The bible says in James 2:10, &#8220;For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble at one point, he is guilty of all&#8221;. If I have a nice jar and I drop it and it cracks even a little bit, I have shattered it&#8217;s perfection. It&#8217;s goodness has been shattered.<\/p>\n<p>In Luke 18:18 tells us about a certain ruler who came to Jesus and said, &#8220;Good Teacher&#8221;, what shall I do to inherit eternal life. I would imagine Jesus telling him how to but instead, he first defined what good is. vs. 19, &#8220;So Jesus said to him, &#8220;Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God&#8221;. Jesus was and is God therefore He was good, the ruler thought he was good until Jesus gave him 5 commandments not related to men to which he hadn\u2019t kept. Remember the girl who looked at the sheep? this man had passed the test before men until the snow of God&#8217;s righteousness fell (test before God) and saw himself under God&#8217;s background of what good is. At that point he saw he was not good at all and went away sad. He had not kept the first commandment. So God is the definition of good, look at His commandments and see that is the only one that has kept them because He is good. We sing God is good in every circumstance, in every situation. Computers are good sometimes and so is snow yet God is good ALL THE TIME. Listen to Paul speaking, a man who is responsible for most of the new testament, Romans 7:18, &#8220;For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells;&#8221; Romans 3:12, &#8220;They have all turned aside; They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one&#8221;. The only good thing in me is Christ Himself. When God looks at me He sees Christ and therefore He cannot deny Himself cause like Father like Son. I wanted to be discouraged because I wasn&#8217;t good but I thought to myself, as long as I am not good I need Him who is good, I depend on Him, I live for Him. If I had everything going on for me I would not need Him. I am not good but He is good, I do good things and He takes the credit.

Too often today people claim the promises, but forget the conditions, and possibly the greatest condition of discipleship is the complete submission of our will for the perfect will of God. We often like to interpret God\u2019s will as ours, but so often we are far from the mark. When one truly comes to Christ, when they are truly born again, they surrender their will at the cross. All sin, all willful transgression is forsaken, and we now walk by faith in obedience to the Word of God. We can go back, we can take up those things again, but to do so is to forfeit our standing in Christ. Faith is ongoing, always moving forward, unto the perfect will of God.<\/p>\n<p>Paul here warns us not to be conformed, or fashioned, after this world. We are not to behave as this world, partaking in its lusts and entertainments, its drink and its delicacies. We are further instructed to be transformed, which is the same Greek word used for what happened on the Mount of Transfiguration, we are to be transfigured. We must undergo a divine change, we must be born again, by no other means can we come to God the Father, we must bear the resemblance of His Son. Next, Paul writes it is by the renewing of our minds this happens. The word renewing does not refer to some minor undertaking, no beloved, it means our minds are to be renovated, to be made completely new, where the old thoughts have passed away, I now have the mind of Christ. We no longer desire what we once did, we find less and less enjoyment in the things of this world. Our minds are made new, completely new, entirely renovated, everything has been torn down, the whole place gutted, and an entirely new structure is built, all upon Christ, for now I have lost sight of all else but Him. He has become everything to me, and I renounce all that is not of Him. This is the New Testament standard of Christianity.<\/p>\n<p>All of this leads to the end result, that we may prove, that we may know, that perfect will of God. And what is the perfect will of God? Let us go to the Word. I Thessalonians 4:3- this is the will of God, your sanctification, your holiness. God\u2019s will , after our salvation, is that we would be holy, now, in this life, by the internal workings of His divine grace in response to a heart fully surrendered to Him by a humble and contrite faith, a burning desire for a deeper walk with Him. This is the life pleasing to God. We must be holy as He is holy, and it will only come as we are willing to submit ourselves wholly unto Him.

Be a Jesus seeker:  This woman in the midst of her situation became a Jesus seeker. She made it upon herself to find Jesus. Mathew 9:20, &#8220;And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment&#8221;. She decided to make a quick move before the opportunity passed her by. It was either now or never. If you and I are going to make it this year, we must be like this woman who sought to be made well. She sought after the one who could make her well, it\u2019s one thing to desire, it&#8217;s another thing to do something about it. Deuteronomy 4:29, &#8220;But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and with all your soul&#8221;. Don&#8217;t wait for people to seek the Lord for you, be initiative, and wait on God. This woman had no time to seek special help from people for her condition, she knew who to call on, the reason she moved swiftly and not wait for any special treatment someone else might have given her. You seek the Lord and you will find Him. She did not care to see Him or talk to Him all she cared was a taste of what He had, the healing virtue. Can we get to that place where we are desperate to just have a glimpse of what He has?<\/p>\n<p>2. Be you own best encourager: She became her best encourager. vs. 21, &#8220;For she said within herself, If I may but touch the hem of His garment, I shall be made whole&#8221;. If you have tried everything and failed, it takes a greater faith to attempt the impossible. Jesus had spoken to many, touched them and healed them, for this woman, her faith was just to touch what He is wearing was enough to make her whole. This faith did not just come about, she had to do something about it, and she became her best encourager. Faith is boosted when encouragement comes in. It&#8217;s good to have people encourage but sometimes it\u2019s good to build your own foundation of encouragement. &#8220;I will make it despite what the enemy brings my way; I am determined not to remain in the same place forever. I may fall, stumble, or even cry but I will still make it because I know that He has something I don&#8217;t have. If I can just but touch Him, I will never be the same again.<\/p>\n<p>3. Your yesterday cannot not shape your tomorrow: Her yesterday could not help her get where she was going. She had every reason to sit and cry over the past and how it should have turned out. At times you have to dry your tears over those who frustrated you or things that stood on the way and realize the Lord is not done with you yet.  He is doing a new thing, Paul encourages himself by saying, Philippians 3:13&#8230; but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead&#8221;. The fact you and I are still here shows there are things that have been deposited in the womb of our spirits that cannot be negated by yesterdays&#8217; issues. Yes there are a lot that had passed her by while she was still in her condition yet she understood that &#8220;Behold Christ makes all things new&#8221;. Tomorrow can be vibrant if your past is buried from haunting you.<\/p>\n<p>4. Have hope and faith to make it: Regardless of who she was she still had hope and faith to make it. Anyone can believe God when things are going the right way or you can see how things will turn out. It takes a greater faith to believe God in the midst of hopelessness. Faith in God can move mighty mountains, that is what she had at the very hour of her hopelessness. She did not just believe and sit there, she put her faith to work by seeking to touch the hem of His garment. James 2:26, &#8220;&#8230;for faith without works is dead also&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We have an awesome opportunity to grow in the Lord this year. Refuse therefore to be where you were yesterday, move and let everyone know if you must, &#8220;I&#8217;m not where I was, don&#8217;t look for me on my yesterday&#8217;s issues and failures. I moved on, God is growing me in every aspect of my life&#8221; Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Mathew 9:20-22, &#8220;And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment&#8221; As we looked at the woman with the issue of blood yesterday, we could glean some principles from her story and apply it to our lives as we [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-2030","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-wK","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2030","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=2030"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2030\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2031,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/2030\/revisions\/2031"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=2030"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=2030"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=2030"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":2034,"date":"2011-01-04T19:22:00","date_gmt":"2011-01-04T13:52:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2011\/01\/04\/im-not-where-i-was-part-1-by-evans-2\/"},"modified":"2011-04-13T07:38:29","modified_gmt":"2011-04-13T02:08:29","slug":"im-not-where-i-was-part-1-by-evans-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2011\/01\/04\/im-not-where-i-was-part-1-by-evans-2\/","title":{"rendered":"I&#8217;m Not Where I was, Part 1, by&nbsp;Evans"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Mathew 9:20-22, &#8220;And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Happy New Year. It feels good to do devotions again after some time of silence, 4th quarter closings, was out sick for two days and my brother Jimmy got married. Let me encourage us as we start this new year.<br \/>Many make resolutions into the new year only to fail early due to making it by human efforts. Instead of making resolutions, I prefer making declarations for the new year. Declarations I commit to God knowing that I can only make it through Him. What amazes me about starting the new year is the fact that we are all anticipating a victorious, glorious year. You hear it said or even preached that this new year is going to be a greater than the previous year. I don\u2019t think that is always the case. As yourself this question, was the previous year more great than the year before that? Can you say 2010 was better than 2009 and that 2009 was better than 2008? If we were to evaluate each year and be honest with yourself, there is a possibility that someone would say nothing or very little things changed. If anything, they might have been worse compared to the previous years. Great expectations in the new year, only to discover dealing with the same issues you dealt with in the previous year. Very discouraging.<\/p>\n<p>We are all familiar with the story of the woman with the issue of blood. Her name is not given to us for it is not important to the revelation of the text however the bible take the time to tell us of her condition for 12 years. Like someone of us, maybe each year she expected to see her condition get better but each time it got worse. She was losing blood every year, she tried to do all that she needed to do to have her condition get better,  not even once in those years did it. Mark 5:26, &#8220;&#8230; had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was not better, but rather grew worse&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure if she looked forward to a new year, I wouldn&#8217;t if I was in her condition especially for many years. She tried it all, spent it all, worked it all to get better in vain. It&#8217;s not a surprise if I heard that someone spent money on books, programs, counselors and the like to get things better in their marriage, raising children, finances, breaking out of a habit and more and still found that none of those worked. So what happens, you fall back on what you dealt with the previous year and you see the same happening in this year. Every good thing she would have loved in her life could not take place because of her condition.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone with an issue of blood cannot get pregnant, they cannot hold what they should hold. You were considered unclean if you had an issue of blood. There could be no fellowship or relationship for that matter. If you have an issue, chances are, you cannot hold fellowship, relationships, the word of God, prayers, witnessing, enthusiasm for the things of God because you are bleeding. Things that would get you pregnant with destiny are aborted before time leaving you frustrated year after year. You try to do your best only to find that you are not going anywhere, if anything your condition is getting worse. Can we carry the same issues again in this new year? I don&#8217;t think so. I don&#8217;t want to deal with the same issues I dealt with in 2010, this is a new year with new beginning. 2010 is gone, we are committing 2011 in the hands of God. The enemy of our soul knows where we are today but don&#8217;t look for us in the same place tomorrow for God is radically changing the course of our destiny. What I leave us with this morning is this question, before you try and get pregnant with destiny, do you have issues of blood to deal with?.

It has been said that Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. Each one has a good reason why they call it the most wonderful time of the year.<\/p>\n<p>A prophesy about a Son to be born happened a few thousand years ago when God gave the prophesy after King Ahaz could not ask for a sign. And the prophesy was very clear about who will be born, how He will be conceived and even the name He was to be given, Immanuel which means God with us. Jesus was coming to this earth taking the form of flesh. I believe to redeem, He had to relate to us human form. He was 100% God and 100% Man, the infinite God Man. And when God brought Him into the world of sin, He made sure that no man contributed to His coming for man has the tendency of trying to take the glory and therefore He made Jesus be born of a virgin. He came to be the Savior of the world and be Lord of all.<\/p>\n<p>Isaiah 9:6, &#8220;For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, And the government will be, upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace&#8221;. Can you imagine a child being born already give these titles? Watch this, after the prophesy in the book of Isaiah, Jesus is born and Matthew records the fulfillment of that prophesy, Math 1:22&amp;23, &#8220;So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: Behold, the virgin shall be with a child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,&#8221; which is translated, &#8220;God with us&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The neat thing is that when Jesus was born, He was born already crowned the King of the Jews (Math 2:2), the wise men guided by the star come to worship the King of Jews also known as the King of kings, and not only did they come to worship, they also brought gifts with them. Can you see that Christmas is not about us but about the King of kings? yes we exchange gifts and yes sometimes we don&#8217;t want to call it Christmas for we would rather call it happy holidays or Xmas.  Letter \u201cX\u201d in math is always considered the unknown number and when we use it in Xmas, to me that sounds like the unknown Man behind Christmas. Jesus Christ is the reason for Christmas and we come to worship Him just as the wise men who said let us go and meet the King of the Jews, bringing Him gifts. We can bring Him gifts of praise, worship, adoration and the like, it&#8217;s all about Him. Oh come let us adore Him, Christ the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>As we celebrate Christmas, let&#8217;s remember that Jesus was born to be the Savior and the King of the world and that He is coming back again soon and this time He is not coming as baby in a manger but as the King of kings and the Lord of lords, Isaiah 9:7, &#8220;Of the increase of His government and peace, and there will be no end, Upon the throne of David and over His Kingdom, To order it and establish it with judgment and justice from that time forward, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this&#8221;. Hallelujah, praised the Lord, Jesus is coming back as a Mighty Man of war.

John Maxwell shares that many people in America associate his name with treachery and betrayal even though his actions occurred over two hundred years ago.  And few remember that Arnold was a brilliant military leader).\u201d  He started out as one thing a brilliant, obedient follower and respectable military leader, but somewhere his heart ended up against the team and leadership he was allegedly committed to.  Maxwell also shares that \u201cTeammates must be able to count on each other when it counts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Remember when Moses choose 12 spies to enter the Promised Land yet only Joshua and Caleb brought a report back from the eyes of faith because they had God\u2019s perspective?  It\u2019s funny I can\u2019t remember the names of the other 10 spies, but only that they died not possessing the Land themselves.  There were twelve called, but only two chosen as faithful.   <\/p>\n<p>Jesus had on \u201cHis team,\u201d both true and false followers.  John 6:66 is said to be one of the saddest verses in all of Scripture.  Why is it that \u201cFrom this time MANY of HIS DISCIPLES turned back and no longer followed Him?\u201d  Well Jesus placed a bench marker, or a scoreboard to divide the team into the fans of Jesus and the followers of Jesus.  The fans will jump on the band wagon when the team appears to be winning, but followers are committed to their team and leader for better or for worse.    In Jn. 6:53, \u201cJesus said to them, \u2018I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you\u2019\u201d.  Jesus drew the line in the sand and allowed each one to decide which side they would stand on.  Jesus was in a sense pointing with one hand to Himself and the other to the exit door and saying as Joshua in Josh 24:15 \u201cBut if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve\u2026,\u201d and so many left Him.  Jesus said in Luke 9:62, \u201cNo one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.\u201d   These disciples not only looked back, but they went back.  Jesus staked the claim that following Him was not to be carried on by sheer will power but by a Spirit following.   Jesus said \u201cThe Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>John 6:67-71 reads, \u201cThen he turned to His twelve and asked \u201cYou do not want to leave too, do you?\u201d.

Jn 6:69 We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.\u201d Jn 6:70 Then Jesus replied, \u201cHave I not chosen you, the Twelve?

Judas betrayed Jesus, and Peter denied Jesus.  Peter repented and became a leader among the disciples, and Judas hung himself.  Judas proved to be a false convert, and Peter a faithful disciple. <\/p>\n<p>Perhaps this is why Jesus said, \u201cThe harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Application:  Where your test comes, and come it will, are you resolved in your heart now that you will follow Jesus no matter the cost?

Many will say to me in that day, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 have we not prophesied in thy name?  and in thy name have cast out devils?  and in thy name done many wonderful works?  And then I will profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity (Matt. 7:21-23).\u201d<\/p>\n<p> Why does it seem like such a surprise to many people that Jesus is looking for their obedience?  It seems pretty logical for Him to expect obedience from His Body, His Church, His Bride.  Don\u2019t you want your physical body to obey you?  If you were in charge wouldn\u2019t you expect those in your guidance to follow your instruction?  If you are married is it not biblical for a bride to listen to their groom, as He loves her as Christ loves the church?  And how did Jesus show His love for the church, he died for the Church, His Body, His Bride.  Jesus just didn\u2019t say He was going to die, Phil 2:8 says, \u201cAnd being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death-even death on a cross! Phil 2:9 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name\u201d. Hebrews 5:8 shows how Jesus came to a place Himself of obedience as the writer points out, \u201cAlthough He was a Son, He learned obedience from what He suffered 9 and, once made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him.\u201d  He was obedient to death on the cross, He learned obedience through what He suffered and because of that became the source of eternal salvation to all whom &#8211; OBEY HIM! Obedience is connected to someone\u2019s salvation.  Those who love Him, will obey Him thus showing their faith in Him by their works for Him (James 1). <\/p>\n<p>However Matt 7 teaches that there are many that are in fact deceived in their thinking that they have eternal life in Him by their outward works, yet inwardly they do not do God\u2019s will.  Jesus stresses that not everyone that calls Him Lord, Lord which reflects both fervency and intimacy, has the depth of relationship that one may think.  There will in fact be those that will be taken by surprise because they will be found to be outside of God\u2019s will by Jesus Himself.  There will be those that will have been exposed as false followers of Christ and it will be revealed on \u201cthat day\u201d [Great Day], the Day of Judgment.  Despite the fact that many will express their self &#8211; deception will be clearly seen by Christ in their deceptions.  They will ask Christ \u201cDid we not preach the message under the inspiration of the Spirit and exercise the prophetic office?  Remember just because one prophesies, does not necessarily equal obedience.  Could not an atheist read the Scripture to another and the hearer genuinely repent because of the power of the Word not the sanctity of the vessel?.   This is why God hates the Lukewarm and will vomit them out of His mouth (Rev. 3:16)  Did not God\u2019s chosen man Saul fall guilty of prophesying all night with the prophets because the spirit of God came upon him, but yet he lived disobedient to the real King, God Himself, (1 Sam 19:20-24)?<\/p>\n<p>The many will proclaim their piety, but it will be found to be false, and they will point to their works, but those too will be insufficient works. Romans 3:20 shows, \u201cbecause by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified in His sight:  for through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.\u201d  They will also try and have Jesus look to their deceptive miracles as well.  These will all ask Jesus to look away from their obedience and only at their deceptive acts.  While our acts and our obedience should be married to one another, these people will have them divorced from one another, and because obedience is not their defining marker they are only left to proclaim their deceptive acts.  Look at the words Christ will give these folks, \u201cI never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.\u201d  He says I never knew you.  That is to say we never had an intimate relationship, and I never approved of your lifestyle.  Jesus Christ learned obedience, modeled it for us, and expects it from us that say we follow Him.  Let\u2019s obey Him, its best for us.    <\/p>\n<p>Application:  2Co 10:5 We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.

Luke 8:20 Someone told him, \u201cYour mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.\u201d Luke 8:21 He replied, \u201cMy mother and brothers are those who hear God\u2019s word and put it into practice.\u201d (Luke 8:19-21<\/p>\n<p> Isn\u2019t it interesting that you can grow up with your family members, but in the long run some of our friends are closer to us in relationship than our own family?  In the church world this would be labeled as a having a kindred spirit.  This is where you and your friend (perhaps your best friend) seem to be so closely connected, you trust one another deeply there for one another faithfully and sacrificially, that it supersedes your relationship to your family.  It\u2019s been said that blood is thicker than water.  This is to say that family relationship is to be a stronger than a friendship one because of the family bloodline.  Perhaps this saying was made up by someone that saw the closeness of two friends as being greater than the closeness of one of their family members and them, this statement was born out of jealousy.  Even though the saying blood is thicker than water is believed by many, perhaps spirit is thicker than blood, or better yet the blood and spirit of Jesus is thicker than anything. <\/p>\n<p>Jesus\u2019 mother Mary came to see Him along with His brothers.  Jesus was inside ministering or at least being with people.  There was enough of a crowd gathered there to keep His family from getting near to Him. Upon hearing that His own mother that gave birth to Him, and nurtured Him growing up, and His own brothers that He had grown up with desired to see Him, He answers to the surprise of many with unexpected words. Knowing His family came to see Him, Jesus says \u201cMy mother and brothers are those who hear God\u2019s word and put it into practice.\u201d  Now talk about throwing someone off.  Jesus seems to make no exception to have His family members outside come to see Him, and He rolls no red carpet out to them.  On the contrary if there had been a \u201cred carpet\u201d it appears that He would pull it away.  By the very statement given to Jesus, one would expect a much different response, especially in a society where honoring your father and mother was highly esteemed.  Yet Jesus gave no more honor to His mom and brothers than the rest of humanity.  As blessed as Mary was for being chosen by God to be the mother of Christ, she and His brothers were to submit to the family as Jesus defined it, as He said \u201cMy mother and brothers are those who hear God\u2019s word and put it into practice.\u201d  \u201cJesus says that the way to be close to him-even as close as His own family-is through being receptive to (&#8220;hearing&#8221;) God&#8217;s word and then doing it. Hours of praying and reading the Bible will not bring disobedient Christians as close to the Lord as doing His truth brings even the simplest believer (EBC).\u201d <\/p>\n<p> Later on in the book of Luke, a woman in the crowd called out, \u201cBlessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.\u201d  He replied, \u201cBlessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it (Luke 11:27-28).\u201d  He is looking for obedience to define His family.  This is really nothing new as Jesus is consistent even from His boyhood.  Remember at the age twelve Mary and Joseph accidentally left Jesus in Jerusalem, and upon their return being very anxious, His mother said to him, \u201cSon, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.\u201d Why were you searching for me?\u201d He asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know I had to be in my Father\u2019s house (NIV), [\u201c\u2026dealing with the things of my father\u201d &#8211; the message Bible] (Luke 2:48-49)?\u201d  Later Luke shows the place family must take in the life of one who desires to be Jesus&#8217; disciple (14:25-26).  Jesus states, \u201cIf anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters-yes, even his own life-he cannot be my disciple.\u201d  He is to be at the top of your \u201clove list\u201d shown through obedience.  Even Jesus\u2019 half-brother James who did not believe until after Jesus\u2019 death stated, \u201cBut be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves.\u201d James 1:22,  He too recognized that those who call themselves followers of Christ must manifest the words through their obedience to His Words.  Apart from obedience growing up in a Christian home, going to church, and practicing spiritual disciplines can never outweigh the simplicity of obedience, which is what He wants from His Church, His Body, and His bride. <\/p>\n<p> Application:  If you were placed on trial for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?

To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams. 1Sa 15:23 For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In Luke 6:46, Jesus asks this question, \u201cWhy do you call me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 and do not do what I say?  He is trying to show some common sense in this passage.  He asks in the first part of his question, \u201cWhy do you call me Lord,\u201d of your life and yet you don\u2019t obey me as Lord?  Doesn\u2019t Lord have some clout to it, showing a place of supreme importance?  In Hebrew the word Lord means \u201c\u201dsupreme in authority, controller, (as respectful title) God, Lord, master, sir.  Seeing this definition gives credence to his question.  Think of a building land lord.  He is the lord of that land.  If the land lord says you can live here or you can\u2019t live here, they are the lord of the land (building) and therefore their word goes.  In the second aspect of His question notice he doesn\u2019t say \u201cYou don\u2019t hear the things I say,\u201d but rather you \u201c\u2026do not do what I say.\u201d  The Message Bible says it like this, \u201cWhy are you so polite with me, always saying \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 and \u2018That\u2019s right, sir,\u2019 but never doing a thing I tell you?\u201d  Jesus is trying to show the inconsistency that He sees, with calling the person in charge, Jesus, Lord, yet disobeying His will.  You can\u2019t call Jesus Christ Lord and yet still live completely contrary to His Word.  If you do, it only proves that He is not really your Lord. <\/p>\n<p>Matt 7:6-8 illustrates this beautifully as Jesus says, He replied, \u201cIsaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: \u201c\u2018These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.\u2019  You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men.\u201d Notice the words near and far.  These people Jesus is speaking of had lips that were near calling Him Lord, yet their heart of obedience was far from His heart and will.  Jesus doesn\u2019t want mere lip service, but a surrendered heart service.  The position of your heart, near or far, will determine the position of your obedience.<\/p>\n<p>Hear the words of doctor Luke as he wrote Jesus\u2019 analogy on the wise and foolish builders. Luke 6:47-49 reads, \u201cI will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice. He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built. But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jesus is showing that there is no way your life is going to crash by the weather patterns of life when you are obedient to His word, but the disobedient life will have a complete collapse and total destruction.  The testing ground will determine if the kind of person you profess to be, an obedience follower, is what you really are. <\/p>\n<p>Consider the words of the Apostle Paul, In 1 Cor 13 known as the \u201clove chapter.\u201d \u201cIf I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.  If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.\u201d  I personally don\u2019t promote this movie however a friend of mine used to utter these words from the movie Billy Madison when he said, \u201cI see your lips moving but I can\u2019t hear your words.\u201d  Jesus sees many lips moving but He wants those moving lips to translate into obedient words shown by a tested life which displays faithful obedience to the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Application:  Do you call Him Lord, and if so where is you obedience?

As a matter of fact we are in an age where information is in abundance.  There are so many avenues by which we can \u201chear\u201d information.  And when it comes to hearing godly things this too is not scarce.  However, despite all of this hearing, how much of it do we actually apply to our lives?  Jesus made a definite distinction between hearing and listening or better yet obeying.  I once heard it said, hearing is what we do with our ears, listening is what we do between them.  Jesus gives an analogy of two lives.  In Matt 7:24-27 He says, \u201cTherefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. 26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. 27 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>He stressed that live issues will beat our lives.  There are many issues such as relationships, family, finances, employment, and health, to name a few.  And like weather patterns the floods, rains, and winds of life will attack our lives without favoritism.  It\u2019s interesting that Jesus likened the two houses to two lives, both of which had heard His everlasting words.  Yet only one of the houses remains intact after the storms of life hit.  And it was only the house that stood the test of time that Jesus commended.  In fact He called this house the wise man.  Why, because this was the one that applied or obeyed His words and did more than simply hear His words.  Jesus gives no second place, no silver medal to the life of a mere hearer, or to say plainly the disobedient life.  Hearing is the starting place, but listening is running to the finishing line!  Jesus was illustrating that you are either convinced by the Spirit of God of my teaching and it becomes the very foundation of rock to sustain your life. Or you truly are in doubt because although you hear, you show outwardly by the failure to apply my Words to your life, that you chose to build your life as a sandcastle rather than a strong tower.  <\/p>\n<p>This life Jesus called a foolish one.  You see Jesus was never at a loss for crowds, but He wasn\u2019t after crowds for the sake of just having a crowd.  He gathered crowds from the beginning of His earthly ministry all the way to His crucifixion and beyond, no, He desired the crowd to become obedient followers of Him.  If there is an area that needs improvement in our Christians lives it surely is this whole issue of obedience.  Now who among us can say that we display perfect obedience?  I imagine that no one would raise their hand to proclaim their perfection based on their actions.  Yet this is precisely what Jesus is and has been calling for, obedience.  There is a clear distinction, either your house is built on the rock or on the sand.  Even a child can kick over a sandcastle, no matter how ornate the builder may have made it.  God only builds with rock.  People will either have their lives built on the shifting sands of this world, by only hearing and thus failing to apply the words of Christ, or they will know that God is the builder of their house because they apply His words to their lives.  Psalm 127:1 reads, \u201cUnless the LORD builds the house, its builder\u2019s labor in vain.\u201d  In speaking of the faith of Abraham Hebrew 11:10 states, \u201cFor he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.\u201d  God builds on obedience, for then our lives are pliable for Him to make, mold, and build us in the way He knows best.  He is the diving carpenter; will His hands find an obedient and humble life or a prideful and foolish one?<\/p>\n<p>Application:  In what area do you find it most difficult to obey God and why?

I know of a young girl who traveled from a different city and attended our all-night prayer, yet, one month after that, she got married to a hindu man and he has thereafter become a snare in her life. They live separately now, and she is in deep sorrow. Friend, the Bible clearly warns us to be &#8216;overcomers&#8217; until the end.. is it not?

Mark that! Your heart beats, your eyes pop out., everything that used to happen before, does happen now, but the good news is, YOU DON&#8217;T GIVE IN TO TEMPTATION ANYMORE. La, la, la. let us shout Hallelujah! I talk to you guys openly because, I don&#8217;t want you to shrink and feel guilty, when those feelings does come on you, because the enemy plants all those things in the mind.

I have said &#8216;no&#8217; to secular movies, secular magazines, gossip zones (even when I travel alone for ministry, I stick to my room)and anything that would bring a wall between me and God. I aggressively stick to Him &#8211; without which the devil would play football with us.<\/p>\n<p>Aaron (brother of Moses) started his ministry with a bang, being the mouth piece for Moses and was also the man to first perform signs and wonders in front of the people.

Then he did the signs in the sight of the people.&#8217; However, the above scripture states that on the fortieth year &#8211; that is the last year of their wandering in the desert, when they were almost in the border of Canaan &#8211; both Moses and Aaron made a mistake and they died without seeing the promised land.

Are you right now having piled up needs like a high mountain? Do you feel discouraged and distressed over some things that do not seem to give up, no matter how much you pray? Are there issues in your life and around you, which have built up into mountains too high for you to climb? Do you feel like giving up, at times, because you do not seem to be heading the right direction or realizing your dreams or having your desires met?<\/p>\n<p>Whatever your case may be, I want you to know that there is no mountain standing on your way, which can stop you from becoming the person God created you to be. Obstacles, which appear like huge mountains can be great stepping-stones to greater victories and success in our lives. Without them, we would not know how powerful our God is and the value of His grace upon our lives.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to turn any mountain in your life to a flat plain, there are three steps I recommend to you take today and always, whenever you face the impossible mountains:<\/p>\n<p>1. Decide to depend entire and totally on the Spirit of God for your victory. Your strength, strategies, ideas, friends, church, family, finances, talents, skills etc. may be great and helpful, but will not by themselves push any mountain from your way. You need God &#8220;For it is not by might (personal strength or power) by my Sprit says the Lord. God is dependable and capable of meeting any need, if it\u2019s according to His will. He is God of all flesh and nothing is impossible with Him (Jeremiah 32:27).<\/p>\n<p>2. Determine in your heart to finish whatever you have started. Run to finish the race (1Corinthians 9: 24-27). Many people quit salvation, relationships, marriages, ministry, dreams and projects they started because they came a cross impossible mountains. Ze-rub-ba-bel, in the passage I referred to, was assure that if he stayed on, he would finish what he had started, not by his might but by the Spirit of God.<\/p>\n<p>3. Despise not the days of small beginnings or small things. Rejoice over your small achievements and praise the Lord for them. Give thanks in all things at all times. Testify of the Lords power and provisions in your life. Exalt Him and give Him the glory for the great things He has done and has promised to do. Remember great things grow from small beginnings. Mighty oak trees grow from tiny seeds. There is a seed of greatness planted in you. It needs time for it to grow into its fullest potential. Trust God. Look up to Him for help. Your up look will determine your outlook. Let Him turn every mountain in your life into a flat plain.

By Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThen Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.  There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.  3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.  Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon\u2019s son, which should betray him, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?  This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.  Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying has she kept this.  For the poor always you have with you; but me you have not always.\u201d  (John 12:1-7)<\/p>\n<p>Jesus was getting closer toward the end when he would go to the cross.  The relationships he made during his time would now begin to show their true colors, and some would be as precious oil, while others would be as abrasive sandpaper. <\/p>\n<p>In this passage fiver names, which represent four relationships are mentioned which are Lazarus, Martha, Mary and Judas.  How did each relationship form, and where is the relationship at this point leading up to His final days, as oil or sandpaper?<\/p>\n<p>Fist, Lazarus we know was the man that Jesus loved and raised from the dead. Lazarus had been in a tomb.  All his dreams, goals, aspirations, and relationship were dead with him.  He was wrapped up like a Christmas present, but he didn\u2019t look pretty.  He was in this tomb four days which was significant because after three days all hope of resuscitation from a coma would be abandoned; and in the hot Palestinian climate, decay would have begun.  Jesus said to a worrying Martha that was helpless with her abilities in this situation, \u201cYour brother will rise again.\u201d  Misunderstanding Him, she thought on the Pharisaic belief in an ultimate resurrection for the just (Acts 23:7).  However Jesus walked up to the tomb, called for the stone to be removed and cried with a loud voice, \u201cLazarus, come forth.\u201d  The words of Jesus cut through the icy grip of death like a white-hot blade through soft powdered snow.  Death\u2019s stinger is removed, and its grip relinquished as Lazarus walked out of tomb, alive again.  Now here he is sitting with Jesus the one that gave him back his life, restored his dreams, and his relationships.  He was closely following the one that saved his life.  I believe that he is being like oil to Jesus by being with him.  How closely are you following the Lord that called you from death unto life?<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, Martha was serving doing what she is known for.  In times past when Jesus had been to Martha\u2019s home, she ran around doing for Jesus stuff, but never stopped to just spend time with Jesus.  When Mary sat with Jesus he said that Mary had chosen the better.  It seems at this time that not much had changed.  She was still a busybody for Jesus, and even though I\u2019m sure Jesus appreciated her efforts on one hand, He had wanted her to sit and be with Him.  I believe she acted as a little oil to Christ, as she was still serving him, but she could have been more like soothing oil if she would slow down and just be with him.  Are you so busy for Jesus that you never slow down just to be with Jesus?  If the Devil can\u2019t tempt us to sin, he can just keep us busy instead.  Where is your level of busyness at verses your level of intimacy with Christ? <\/p>\n<p>Application: Are you more like Lazarus being with Christ or more like Martha busy for Christ?  Make the change today that needs to be made.

The Father loved His children so much He demonstrated it by sending His Only begotten Son to die for us. John reminds us that no longer are we referred to us children of God but sons (daughters) of God.<\/p>\n<p>Listen to this part &#8220;Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is&#8221; . From being bestowed to being called beloved; and from should to now sons, passing from death to life. This is where we need to identify with our new birth because someone who was guilty of love brought us to a new level we never deserved.<\/p>\n<p>We are daily being conformed to the image of Christ. Being transformed to be like Him, Philippians 2:5, &#8220;Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus&#8221;, this is love of Christ to the point of death. So if the mind of Christ was to do the will of the Father, what is required of us now that He has appeared to us?, John says, &#8220;We shall be like Him&#8221; in other words we will also be guilty of love because we have learnt what it means to be loved. What did Jesus say in John 15:10, &#8220;If you keep My commandments (teachings), you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father&#8217;s commandments and abide in His love&#8221;. John 14:15, &#8220;If you love Me, keep My commandments&#8221;. This is how we demonstrate our love for Him by keeping His commandments (teaching, statutes). When you love someone, you do things to please them and we love God enough to desire to please Him in words, thoughts and deeds. Pleasing the Lord is what matters to me.<\/p>\n<p>John&#8217;s writing on love blows my mind because he teaches us that one aspect of loving God is loving our neighbors (brothers). 1John 3:10, &#8220;&#8230;Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother&#8221;. He goes a head to remind us of Christ&#8217;s love that we may adopt His lifestyle of the outworking of love, 1John 3:16,&#8221; By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren&#8221;. Are we guilty of love or are we guilty of not loving our brothers?. We are not told to love with words but love in action, 1John 3:18, &#8220;My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth&#8221;. God will not tell us to do what He has not done Himself, He put it all on the line and we have to put it all on the line. Take time to read 1John 3 and 4, there is so much in them.

Let me take a few minutes and share something the Lord dropped in my spirit this morning. Everyone desires to be accepted and beyond that loved. Love goes far beyond like for instance, there are those people you don\u2019t like yet you love them. You will cry at their funeral but will not go on a vacation with them yet you love them. Knowing that you are loved gives you a sense of belonging and worth and who does not want that?<\/p>\n<p>In my text this morning, we hear John talking to us about the love of God. He starts by saying \u2018behold\u2019 by which he is bringing to our attention. I know of people who walk around as though they are not loved and it\u2019s because they have never gone past their guilt and failure to know that God does not love us based on what we did. His love to us is based on what He did. Therefore there is nothing we can do to make God love us more and there is nothing we can do to make God loves us less. His love is unconditional, does not have boundaries and has no limitations. So John says look, walk in it, live in it. \u2018What manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us\u2019, when I study the word of God, I like to pick out some words used and understand what their meaning in relation to the revelation of the text. Let\u2019s look at the word \u2018Manner\u2019, which is a way of acting and how did God act to show us He loved us? He did not just say it, He demonstrated it. Romans 5:8, \u2018But God demonstrated His love towards us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us\u2019. If you love someone, you will not just love them with your words, you will demonstrate it. Jesus was guilty of that account and that guilt of love put Him on the cross. He wasn\u2019t put on the cross because He was guilty of sin. John sees this kind of love and reports it to us. Here was a Man who put it all on the  line. We would like to love those who love us back yet Jesus loved all knowing that one would betray Him, another will deny Him and He would be left alone, what manner of love?. His love was bestowed upon us in other words given to us as a gift. We never deserved or qualified for it, it\u2019s just bestowed.<\/p>\n<p>Amazing thing, with that love we now should be called the sons (daughters) of God. Being referred to as a child of God does make an impact like being referred to as a son or a daughter of God. That is so personal because I am beginning to understand that He loves me to call me His son and I can call Him My Father and better yet, My Daddy. If no one ever tells you they love you, just walk to the mirror, look at yourself and say, \u2018HE LOVES ME\u2019. I can\u2019t rub off that love, can no one tell me otherwise because I know that His love for me is better than life itself. He loved me enough to die for me, He put His love on the line for me, there is nothing I can do to make Him love me more or less all I know is that, \u2018He loves me\u2019. If we were to say Christ was guilty, we would say He was guilty of loving us.

She was condemned because of what she did, Jesus takes the opportunity to ask her accusers to throw a stone at her if none of them had sinned. John 8:9, &#8220;Then those who heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one beginning with the oldest even to the least&#8221;. Looking at this verse, Jesus did not condemn the Scribes and the Pharisees, what He said to them caused them to be convicted by their own conscience. The word conscience comes from two words \u201cCon\u201d which is &#8220;with&#8221; while \u201cScience\u201d is &#8220;knowledge&#8221;. They knew they own guilty state because their conscience convicted them.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you but I am glad that they brought her to Jesus. When I have fallen and deserve to be stoned, please take me to Jesus the one full of compassion, full of mercy, full of grace. He does not condone sin but He sure loves the sinner. As for this woman, Jesus did not like her sin and could not just say it was okay, she was condemned already but He loved her so much to bring her out of condemnation. John 8:10, &#8220;When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, &#8220;Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you&#8221;, vs. 11, &#8220;She said, &#8220;No one Lord&#8221;. If everyone left, why would Jesus not leave. Very simple, everyone who left had committed sin but Jesus was pure. The bible says that He was a 100% man yet without sin. The Lamb of God with no spots or wrinkles. He was complete within Himself lacking nothing. Here is a woman left before Jesus with three words keep ringing in her mind, guilty, guilty, guilty. Can you imagine what must have been going through her mind at that time? At first she knew of what would happen according to the law of Moses and that is to die, but that has been put aside, &#8220;what is he going to do with me? must have through her mind. John 8:11,\u201d&#8230;And Jesus said to her, \u201cNeither do I condemn you; go and sin no more\u201d. Did she hear Him correctly about what He said, \u201cHe has no sin and yet He is not condemning me\u201d . She receives a gift of forgiveness when she deserves to die, Romans 6:23, &#8220;For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal live in Christ Jesus our Lord&#8221;. She receives the gift of eternal life after being accused of sinning. The rest who left, went back in their sins and the man who she was caught with in adultery remained in sin. In the minds of the accusers, they made a mistake when they brought her to Jesus. Alone in His presence, vulnerable and helpless gave the Master a chance to cleanse her and set her free. When the law has chased you to the cross and left you helpless, that is when Jesus steps in with mercy and grace. Three things she received that day, mercy, a promise and commission. When she was brought, Jesus showed her mercy by not saying okay to the people to stone her. He also gave her a promise, \u201cneither do I condemn you\u201d then He commissioned her, \u201cGo and sin no more\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Who is like Jesus, we mess up big time and yet He is still calling us and telling us in 1John 1:9, \u201cIf we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness\u201d. Why are many harboring sin and holding on to it? is it because they don\u2019t think that they can be forgiven? Many have made promises that they will not go back to do the same things but sooner or later, they found themselves in it again. And because of that, they don\u2019t believe that they can be forgiven and be free. Guilt is killing you for your conscience is accusing you and you are being convicted, it\u2019s time to make things right with God. David in talking to God said in, Psalm 51:16, \u201cYou do not desire sacrifice, or else I would give it; You do not delight in burnt offering. vs. 17, \u201cThe sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and contrite (deeply sorry, remorseful, repentant) heart\u201d. Just as this woman could not bring sacrifices, she had a broken and contrite heart and with that she received what she wasn\u2019t expecting. I pray that we will never take the sin issue lightly for God hates sin. He\u2019s love is demonstrated in His justice therefore God must punish sin. Check where you have glossed over sin, and let the Holy Ghost conviction arrest you and bring you to His presence that you might repent of it.<\/p>\n<p>One last thing, when the woman was forgiven, she must have walked boldly on the streets again, more free, rejoicing and the like. No one could condemn her anymore for something she did was now a history. Romans 8:1, \u201cThere is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit\u201d. Was condemned, not any more for I am forgiven. I did not earn or worked for it, but He freely gave it to me. Romans 4:7, \u201cblessed are they whose sins are forgiven, and those whose sins are covered!!!!. I was once condemned but now I am forgiven how about you?

We have defects, blemish, imperfections, errors and all these things mentioned have shattered our perfection leaving us as guilty sinners before a holy God. We say things we should not, do things  we should not, neglect things we should do. We shatter God&#8217;s law and sometimes gloss over the seriousness of it to the extent of trying to cover when it\u2019s hard to deal with it. What is wrong with a little bit of lust here and there?, what is the big deal if I say something to someone and I am okay with it even if they are not? Our imperfection leads us to want to be forgiven but there can be not forgiveness without repentance.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus was teaching on mount Olives very early one morning, before long the Scribes and the Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in His presence &#8220;they said to Him, &#8220;Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act&#8221;, John 8:4. I&#8217;m amazed for number one, one woman brought to Jesus by many people. Second, they say that she was caught in the very act. If she was caught in the act and we know that adultery is a participation of at least two, my question is, where was the man??? They concentrated on what the woman did but  nobody was mentioning the man she was caught with. She had been accused, her conscious told her that she was wrong and deserved to be stoned to death. She had been ashamed before everyone else, she had been stripped of her dignity and there was nothing she could do to get out of it. Our guilty state strips us of the same things because our conscious accuses us and the accuser of brethren never ceases to fuel our guilt before God. And with all the accusations, we are left helpless. DL Moody said, &#8220;The law can only chase a person to the cross, not any further&#8221;. The law does not help us, it leaves us guilty and helpless.<\/p>\n<p>John 8:5, &#8220;Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?, vs. 6, This they said testing Him, that they have something of which to accuse Him&#8221;. These people were not concerned about justice otherwise they would have brought the man too, they had an agenda and therefore they used this woman as a bait. They knew what the law said, but they were more concerned about how it affected someone else and not them. It can be very easy to look at someone\u2019s flaws and neglect yours and it could be backed up by this thought, &#8220;Mine is not as bad as theirs&#8221;. Before God a law broken is the same regardless of its magnitude. An example, if you have a perfect jar and you drop it, even if the crack on it is very small, you have shattered it&#8217;s perfection. James 2:10, &#8220;For whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend it at one point is guilty of all&#8221;. You break one, you\u2019ve broken them all. The way you look at it does not matter, the fact remains that you and I have shattered the perfection of that jar and ought to be punished. John 8:6, &#8220;&#8230;But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though He did not hear&#8221;. Could it be possible that the reason why Jesus decided to be quiet was to give the scribes and the Pharisees an opportunity to examine themselves and see if they had not broken the law themselves?. They were too quick to judge without first examining themselves, so without wasting any more time, they asked Him again John 8:8, and He said to them, &#8220;He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first&#8221;. Tough question to deal with but the ball is rolled back to their court. You came to accuse but now you are being convicted of your own flaws for you know that you too have shattered the laws of God. \u201cBut Lord it&#8217;s not about me but about someone else I brought before You. I came to pray about them not necessarily for them. I did not even come to ask You to forgive them, I wanted them condemned\u201d. By one woman&#8217;s act, not only is she convicted of her sins, but through her many are also convicted who saw themselves good and clean in the sight of God.<\/p>\n<p>What do I do when I am convicted and I deserve to be stoned to death, I could deny but the Holy Ghost caught me sinning. I cannot lie because that would mean breaking another law. I have enough flaws and yet I also have accusers on my case, I cannot justify myself for three words come in mind, guilty, guilty, guilty.

I pour out my complaint before him; before him I tell my trouble.  When my spirit grows faint within me, it is you who know my way. In the path where I walk men have hidden a snare for me.  Look to my right and see; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life.  I cry to you, O LORD; I say, &#8220;You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.&#8221;  Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name.  Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me. (Psalm 142)<\/p>\n<p>Here is David, alone, tired, exhausted, confused, on the run and alone in a cave (before the 400 men gathered to him).  He had taken his food from the fields, slept in trees, hid in ditches, and crawled through mud as he ran.  For days he ran.  Here he was filthy, and lonely.   Perhaps the mothers had told their children that they should behave or else they would end up like the town drunk.  Now kids were being told to be good or else they would end up like the giant killer, David.  David was misunderstood by others.  This cave was now his castle. <\/p>\n<p>I.  Lament (heart cry) of the individual (verses 1 -2). David unreservedly cries out with full emotion ALOUD to the Lord.  Hey if people can scream over their sport\u2019s team we should be able to cry out LOUD to our King.  He called out for mercy which is not getting what we do deserve.  I deserved Hell because I broke God\u2019s Law, but I didn\u2019t get Hell, I got Heaven instead, thank God!    He pours out his complaint to the Lord, not just simply throwing up a whimsical prayer.  His spirit was growing faint (beyond tiredness).  These phrases illustrate the tension between anguish of soul and dependence on the Lord.  Have you ever felt so broken and cried out to the Lord?  This is the prayer of a broken man. <\/p>\n<p>II. Loneliness in Suffering (142:3-7a) My spirit grows faint. His adversary and his prayers had brought David to the place of total exhaustion. He shares that it is the Lord alone that knows his way (life).  He shares that men have hidden a snare for me, people were after David for no good reason!  No one is concerned for me, no one cares about my life he thought.  I have no refuge, there are no places of rest for me. No one cared for my life, I am all alone in this thing.  He feels even the Lord is not at his &#8220;right&#8221; hand. The &#8220;right&#8221; signifies the place where one&#8217;s witness or legal counsel stood.  He had no one to defend him against his adversaries, and his words could not penetrate the hatred in Saul\u2019s heart toward him.  He says of the Lord &#8220;You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.&#8221;  God became his refuge, his safe haven, his only protection.  Only the Lord could rescue David at this point.  This is the prayer of a desperate man. <\/p>\n<p>IV. Public Thanksgiving (142:7b) David moves from despair to thanksgiving believing this feels like the end, but it\u2019s not over for me.  I am not going to stay in this cave of &#8220;Death Valley&#8221; I will have the righteous community to crowd around me and listen to my thanksgiving for the great acts of God&#8217;s deliverance.  This is the prayer of a broken, desperate man that can hope in the Lord and have his heart brought to a place of thanksgiving.<\/p>\n<p>Application:  Will you turn away from God or to God during you lowest times.  Will you move from despair to thanks no matter how alone and broken you are?  Can you hope in the Lord as your refuge, and give up and decide to live in &#8220;Death Valley?!?!&#8221;.

Bala&nbsp;Samson"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>1 Peter 5:10 And the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.<br \/>\nGod sometimes speaks loudly through His Word, I was excited as I read this scripture which refreshed and revitalized me . We should remember that the trials the devil seeks to use to destroy us, God desires to use, to make us stronger and more equipped to follow Him. Every tree that produces fruit, He prunes so as to make it stronger. (John 15:2) Suffering wasn&#8217;t a sign that they were doing something wrong, but Peter reminds us that through the sufferings, God strengthens us spiritually. Satan may try to tear us down through failures, discouragements and humiliation, but God builds you in the midst of all the pain. Want to know more? Stay tuned!<\/p>\n<p>As I look back into my life, the most humiliating moments have been the ones which helped to break me and mold me. We need some breaking in order to be blessed. Too many successes makes us haughty and proud; when God steps in, He loves to cut that off. Remember, Moses was handsome, when he was born but God had to put him 40 years in the wilderness and then make use of him. Never get proud of your height, color, personality and intelligence or whatever; God can spot that subtle ego buried inside you and He would deal with it severely. God has a way to look deep into our sins. We may think it &#8220;small&#8221; and insignificant but it is &#8220;big sin&#8221; for God. Understand? Once while on the stage I suddenly lost the Presence of God near me, I felt lost and scared. I was screaming on the inside for God to give me the anointing back, but He allowed me to suffer on the stage. After the meeting, I fasted and prayed seeking for an answer. God showed certain things which might be petty for me but pretty big deal for Him and He was dealing with me to crucify me and make me fruitful. I can suffer anything in this world but not the pain of losing His anointing, I still shiver at the thought of being left stranded without the anointing! <\/p>\n<p>These words, &#8220;after you have suffered a little while&#8221;, catches our attention, is it not? While waiting on God, seeking the face and advice of my God, he dropped this word into my spirit &#8211; it will only hurt for a little while! Friend, since I am a mother of two children, I can surely explain this better to you this morning. When my children come home hurt and bruised, I would take the first aid box with antiseptics, soap, water, sponge, and bandages in it. My kids would look at my face pathetically and I would lovingly tell them, &#8220;If we don&#8217;t clean it, it will get infected, and besides it will only hurt for a little while.&#8221; When the antiseptic is applied it burns, but it heals. Sometimes children insist on just putting a band-aid on the infected place which would result in the wound getting septic. <\/p>\n<p>God is trying to pour on the antiseptic on our wounds, hurts, and pains. It is only to eventually heal you. The subtle pride that is buried in you, the infection of laziness, rebellion, disobedience, self-righteousness everything would go. God knows everything about us. Sometimes we need &#8216;deep treatment&#8217; for cleansing, but once He touches us, He brings about a marvelous change. The &#8216;treatment&#8217; that God gives us may be in the form of illness, financial loss, job loss, misunderstandings in relationships, rebellious children and so on. Only when it hurts us do we understand the hurt that we had done to others, which stirs us to repent and change. When God pours that antiseptic into your wound you will be reminded of your ill spoken word and you will have to go and ask that person to forgive you. Observe the above scripture closely, it says, &#8216;He will Himself restore you.&#8217; Comforting is it not? He will never leave you to be burnt, but through the trial period, God makes us strong, firm and steady. Blessings, devotion by Sis.

Able to save to the uttermost, the precious blood of Jesus, which washes the vilest of sinners white as snow. No pope, no church, no man can do this, only Jesus. It is not accomplished through good works, reading a Bible, baptism, church membership, education and vain knowledge, nothing but abiding faith in the precious blood of the spotless Lamb of God. He is able, and He is willing, if any will come to Him, He will save them, and as they lay their life down in utter abandonment of sin and self, He will save to the uttermost, to the highest degree. The word uttermost means completely, perfectly, utterly. It points to a complete salvation from all sin, a cleansing of the very nature of men and women, not just a washing, a cleansing from all unrighteousness. He is able, by the blood of His cross, through faith, to save us completely, to sanctify us wholly, to literally make us holy, and keep us holy. No longer wavering, no longer going in and out of sin, no more of the inconsistent \u201cChristian\u201d life. There is no such things as a sinning religion, it doesn\u2019t exist in the New Testament. Christ died for a glorious bride, without spot or wrinkle, holy and without blemish( Ephesians 5:26-27).<\/p>\n<p>He is able, if we will come to Him by faith. If we will surrender our lives to Him, He is able to cleanse us to the uttermost, unto perfection, to sanctify us in an instantaneous moment, to make us holy, not after years and years of growth, no NOW! In a moment, if we will come to God by faith, through Jesus Christ, who even now intercedes for each one. I John tells us that He was manifested to \u201ctake away our sins,\u201d and \u201cthat He might destroy the works of the devil.\u201d (I John 3:5,8) Both these verses point to the utter destruction of our sin, the removal of it from our lives and hearts. This is full salvation, the complete work of the cross, preparing each believer for glorious unhindered growth in Christ, the removal of the weeds in a garden will bring rapid fruitful growth, so the removal of sin will bring fruitful Christian growth. This is the power of the gospel, the purifying of each truly born again believer\u2019s heart by unwavering faith in Christ, and the merits of His cross. <\/p>\n<p>I Corinthians 15:57- But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Is Jesus Lord of your life? Is he really? Then God gives you the victory this day, through Him, that we may live righteous holy lives for the glory of God, proclaiming His truth to a dying world. There is a further work friends, to all who desire it. The Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple(Malachi 3:1), He will burn up all the chaff, he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire(Matthew 3:11-12). Will you come to Him by faith? Will you give Him all He asks? Will you take Him at His word? Will you lay your life down today? Right now? As you read this? Jesus stands ready and willing, He knocks, will we open? Romans 12:1- I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.<\/p>\n<p>In the victorious name of Jesus, and all for His eternal glory, Brother Ben<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Hebrews 7:25- Therefore He is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.

He always takes a different turn and just when you think you have figured Him out, He does something that blows your mind and you are back to seeking to know more. Over and over again I see God raising the unexpected, the one that the blessing was not secured for by man&#8217;s standards, is the one He raises. When You look at Cain and Abel, the blessing rests on Abel, looking at Esau and Jacob, the blessing rests on Jacob, the prodigal son and his older brother, the blessing rests on the unexpected. Abel, Jacob, and the prodigal son have one thing in common, they are second born and no one ever expected them to be blessed Why is this important? simple, God is in the business of raising the second (the unexpected).<\/p>\n<p>The first tends to be stubborn and unwilling to humble himself or bend therefore God always bypasses the first to establish the second. God bypassed Adam the first man created to send Jesus His Only begotten Son, the second Adam. What Adam messed up, Jesus came to fix it. Jesus came to undo what Adam did.<\/p>\n<p>Hebrews 10:9, the theme verse of my life starts by saying, &#8220;He said, &#8220;Behold, I have come to do Your will&#8221;, Jesus came to do the will of the Father, the mark of obedience in the second. For God to build the second, the layer of the first has to come out that the tender heart of the second may be established. While the first may desire to do things his own way, the second is seeking ways to do the will of the Father. In the world we were like the first stubborn born and God had to bypass all that to bring out the inner child inside of us that accepts Him by faith. Mark 10:15, &#8220;Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.&#8221; It&#8217;s not the sophisticated, all knowing and looking able that He raises, He raises the weak, the one who feels he is unable but yet available.<\/p>\n<p>The word &#8220;establish&#8221; means to bring about, to place or settle. What&#8217;s God word saying to us &#8220;He takes away the first that He may establish the second&#8221;. Are you glad that He has called you in spite of your weaknesses, failures, insecurities to establish you simply because you were willing to do His will? He bypassed everything you knew about yourself to build the inner child kind of faith you never knew you had. What you placed second in your life is what He has come to establish. What you never thought He could use is what He is establishing. Our prayer today, Lord establish in our lives what we placed second, insignificant and unexpected. Bypass our pride, arrogance, stubborn and establish our faith, hope, confidence and humility that will also concur the first. As you establish us, establish all that you have brought in our lives.

Through the words of the Lord God Jehovah, he brings out further the need for holiness, and a total separation from the world. Hebrews 12:14 tells us that without holiness, no one shall even see the Lord, as Paul says here, it is our abstaining from all uncleanness, our holy hearts and lives, that cause God to receive us as His children, for we are to resemble Him in every aspect of our lives<br \/>As separation from worldly things and self-denial in the pursuit of holiness brings us closer to God, received as His own as we bear more and more His image, so the presence of willful sin and a disobedient, neglectful lifestyle will remove us from God&#8217;s presence, for He will not dwell with the unclean things, for He is perfectly holy and pure. We can say we are a Christian, but in reality, our sin has grieved away the Holy Spirit, and we stand as a vacated house, a fruitless tree to be cast into the fire. We must come to God, to the foot of the cross, and there leave our lives, forsaking all else to buy and keep this pearl of great price. Our Savior did not die to do us a favor, He died to save and cleanse us from all sin, to gloriously sanctify us in this life by His further workings of grace within, making us holy as He is holy, living in present victory over sin, making us fit to be citizens of the Heavenly city prepared, and holy vessels in this life that He may fill and use for His glory<br \/>Be not mistaken, sin separates us from God, it brings in condemnation and will negate our salvation. Hebrews 10:38 tells us that the just shall live by faith; But if anyone draws back, My soul has no pleasure in Him. To live by faith is to be living in present, active obedience to God, this is how the Greek defines this word in scripture. If we draw back to sin, back to the old ways, God has no pleasure in us. He calls for holiness, and Praise His Name, He gives us His grace, not to cover our sin, but to enable each of us by faith to overcome sin! So let us come this day, boldly to the throne of grace, truly offering our lives to Him, crucifying our will and our lives,  that Jesus may truly live in us, filling and flooding our lives and hearts with His divine glory.

I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow townsmen know that you are a virtuous women.  Ruth 3:8,11<br \/>Boaz, who the Scriptures says  was a relative of  Naomi&#8217;s on her husband&#8217;s side, from the clan of Elimelech, was a man of wealth spoke these powerful, encouraging and defining words of the life of this one women named Ruth.  Ruth had been told by Naomi to wash and put on her best clothes although it is unlikely that an impoverished Ruth would have had best clothes; the Hebrew [word] means only a &#8220;garment.&#8221; Her outer clothing was not defined by wealth by any means.  This is going to be an important issue which we will see in a moment.<br \/>After instructing her not to fear, what did he focus on about Ruth?  He focused on her character, her reputation.  He said for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a virtuous women.  How did everyone know this about her?  This was quite a reputation to hold.  Not just a few people close to Ruth had this testimony of her, but all in the town.  Now we don&#8217;t know how many lived in the town of Bethlehem at that time, but we do know that her character NOT her clothing called attention to her. Why is that important?  This is important to know because her character represented her heart while her clothing represented her outer appearance.<br \/>Remember when God was approving of David and disapproving of Saul.  1 Sam 16:7 reads, &#8220;But the LORD said to Samuel, &#8220;Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.&#8221; (1 Sam 16:7)  We as human beings are easily impressed&#8211;and therefore often deceived&#8211;by what our eyes tell us, while God looks at the &#8220;heart.&#8221;  God sees everything within us. Ruth would surely have answered the question that Proverbs 31:10 poses when it asks, &#8220;A wife of virtue who can find?  She is worth far more than rubies.&#8221;  A beautiful woman by (her outward appearance) is easy to find.  But a virtuous women is worth, is priced, or valued FAR MORE THAN RUBIES.  The more rare a stone is the more precious it becomes.  A woman of such high caliber is worth FAR MORE than any precious stone, diamond, gold, silver.  Paul mentions in 1 Cor. 3:11 &#8220;If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones&#8230;, since valuable metals and precious stones were used to adorn ancient temples (Rev 21:18-21), to portray that a life built with Christ as the foundation is like a life built by things that matter and are costly.  Ruth&#8217;s life was built by things that really mattered, godly character, and everyone saw that godliness in her.  The outer shell will fade away with age.  Everything on a woman that perhaps is firm right now, will sag and become wrinkled one day.  If all a woman possess was her outer beauty when that is gone, what will she have left?<br \/>It is believed that Ruth was in fact a beautiful women outwardly as Ruth 2:5 tells us,&#8221; Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, &#8220;Whose young woman is that?,&#8221; suggesting a beauty and an attraction toward her.  But in the end when they married yes her outward beauty played a part, but it is her inner beauty that kept this man desiring to marry her.  (Ruth 4:13).  Ruth would become mother to Obed, father of Jesse, father of David.  Wow, what a godly heritage!<br \/>Application:  Perhaps you know some women of such character, but are they know by so many for their character.  If you are a woman, yes, keep your beauty outwardly, but let God develop that inward beauty or keep that inward beauty if it is already present in you.  When you stand before the Lord, the outward shell that caused the eyes of the opposite sex to start will be gone, and only your character will stand before God.

We therefore need to learn how we prepare with the tools and the right clothing.<br \/>I face the enemy every single second of the minute of the hour of the days of the months of the year. Sometimes he might just leave me for a season for he is bound to come back. I need to be ready at all times and so should you.<br \/>Paul in concluding his letter to the church at Ephesus had some wisdom to share with them. He knew of the things that they were facing and would continue to face. He begins to conclude his letter by saying, &#8220;Finally my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might&#8221;. This is the introduction to the fight, be strong not in oneself but in the Lord, the overcomer.  James 4:7, Submit yourselves therefore to God, resist the devil and he will flee&#8221;, You cannot resist the devil without first submitting to God. Its in submitting to God that He gives you the strength and grace to resist and that&#8217;s how Paul put it in the next sentence in the same verse &#8220;&#8230;Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles (tricks) of the devil.<br \/>&#8220;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness of this world, against the spiritual wickedness high places&#8221;. We are not fighting some small enemies, we are fighting  big ones and so twice we hear Paul mentioning the act of putting on the whole armor of God. Putting the armor of God is like putting on the combat attire ready for anything that might come as we do not know how big or small they will come.<br \/>Knowing all that we know about what we are going to be facing, we enter into our closets and prepare. . Vs 14, &#8220;Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth&#8221;, the devil is the father of lies, you better put on truth, gird yourself with God&#8217;s word at all times. &#8220;Having put on the breastplate of righteousness&#8221;, it&#8217;s a round the chest where the breastplate is placed and as you can see that this is the area where the heart is and being that God deals with the heart first, when the heart is right with God, the entire being will be changed. &#8220;Having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;&#8221; In Isaiah 52:7, &#8220;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of Him who brings good news&#8221;. The good news does bring peace in ones life, you also overcome when you lead others to find eternal life. Vs 16, Above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one&#8221;, It&#8217;s easy to be wounded if you do not have a shield and here we are told that our shield is the most important thing that we should always have as that we keep us from falling. Heb 11:16, &#8220;Without faith, it is impossible to please Him&#8221;, &#8220;vs 17, Don&#8217;t forget to put on the helmet of salvation&#8221;, I&#8217;ve seen this even with major dangerous sports, they always put on the helmet to protect them from any brain damage if anything ever happens to them. Every believer also has to put on the helmet of salvation as that will protect us in the days when we fall. vs 17, &#8221; and the word of the Spirit, which is the word of God. This is  important too as  this is your only offensive weapon as the rest are defensive weapons. We have to know the word and this could mean memorizing the word and knowing where it is and so that when the enemy begins to fight, we are well equipped. Heb 4:12, The word of the Lord is living and powerful, sharper than any double edged sword&#8230;&#8221;. Remember the enemy knows the word too and so he will come to us the same way he came to Jesus in the wilderness and say &#8220;It&#8217;s written&#8221;, We also need stand with the written word. Paul concludes by telling the Ephesians to pray always will all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints. We need to watch and be ready at all times for, Prayer assists in testing, prepping your tools. Rom 5:8, &#8220;Be sober, be vigilant cause your adversary the devil like a roaring lion walketh about seeking souls that he may devour. Take note of how the bible puts it &#8220;Like a roaring lion&#8221;, he is not the lion as Jesus is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah. We are all soldiers in the army of God, we will fight till the end, choose this day and always to put on your defensive weapons and pick up your offensive weapons to fight back. No retreat no surrender.

It&#8217;s good to know exactly where you fit in as a player in the game. In major sports there are different positions and every player knows their position in the field. I&#8217;m not good at sports so I can&#8217;t tell what positions are there but one thing I know is that there are defense and offense in different sports. The Kingdom of God also has defense and offense structure. Before salvation, &#8220;&#8230;we were enemies of God through wicked works&#8221; Colossians 1:21 for we played or served the devil, and ourselves at salvation, we made peace with God Romans 5:1. We are now on the Lord&#8217;s side.<br \/>If then we be in Christ, we are recruited in the heavenliess Army. We are soldiers in the Kingdom and God is the commander in chief of the armed forces. He is the Mighty Warrior; He is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. Whenever one is in the army, there is an enemy that he or she has to face because there is no way you can be in the war ground and be liked on both sides. One side would hate you and you have to be aware of the fact that you have to be ready at all times you could be called upon. Every believer is at war whether they want to accept it or not. We fight daily because we are constantly under attack. It&#8217;s good to fight but you need to know who your enemy is.<br \/>Many Christians fight the wrong enemy as, the bible in 2Cor 10:3, &#8220;For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh&#8230;&#8221;. The moment you read and understand this verse, is when you will cease to fight your spouse, your children, your neighbor, your workmates, etc. It&#8217;s not a physical battle. People have always been used as a means to accomplish the devils&#8217; dirty tricks. We have had friends who have hurt us, jobs that frustrated us, family members that have discouraged us, situations that have brought pain and frustrations to us, you name it. All these things have one thing in common and the common denominator is that an enemy is behind it. You will also realize that something the Lord could be using to build our faith and teach us endurance, the enemy will try to cease the moment to abort.<br \/>Vs. 4&amp;5, &#8220;For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds, casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God and bringing every thought into captivity under the obedience of Christ&#8221;. Every soldier recruited is given weapons to fight, you cannot be in the army and have nothing or else you will be killed even before you go far. God has given us weapons both offensive and defensive. 2Cor 10:3-5 come in handy when we talk about what we&#8217;ve been equipped with.<br \/>What I am trying to say guys is that we constantly have an enemy and the enemy is not that person or that situation you are thinking of. If you are not facing any challenges and everything is always going on well with you, no tough times to face sometimes, check again and see on whose side are you leaning on. Begin to fight your enemies on your knees.

He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper&#8221;<br \/>\nThere is something about the law of God that puts us in check. It&#8217;s not burdensome or away to put us down, we delight in it. There are three groups of people, 1. people who accommodate the law; 2. Those who hypocritically live under it; 3. Those who love it (His truth). We should be in the third group. It&#8217;s the law that opens our eyes to distinguish between right and wrong and it&#8217;s the law that shows us how much we need God. A little girl  looked at a sheep and thought how white and wonderful that sheep looked then it began to snow. At that point the sheep did not look white anymore because the snow  was much whiter and cleaner than the sheep and the girl thought how dirty the sheep looked. Did the sheep change? no it just appeared in a different back ground and so are we when we look at the standards of men, we look clean but when the snow of God&#8217;s righteousness falls, we all see our short falls and we turn to Him. We don&#8217;t have the law (truth) to condemn us, we have the law to guide us and convict us that we may in turn work towards perfection which is of God. I always do spiritual check to see whether I am heading towards the right direction. Before people point that I am going the wrong way, I want to be the first one to be convicted of it and so I delight myself in His law, meditating upon it day and night, thinking about the Lord, reading His word to guide me as I strive to please Him. If I can just please the Lord,  that is all that matters. Delight in the law of Lord, And meditate on it day and night.<br \/>\nHe shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,. It&#8217;s in the meditating we become like a tree planted by the rivers of water, the sustenance of our life. We need water to be  refreshed and cleansed. We need water to quench our thirst we need it for growth., Our existence depends on our dependence on God, &#8220;without His help, we are doomed to fail&#8221;. Meditate on His law that it may show you how you need Him and then be like a tree planted by His river for growth in Him.<br \/>\nThat brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither. We all have seasons and our seasons depend on what we are into and what we are connected to. The Psalmist tells us that our fruit is a result of where we are planted. Anyone who plants, has an aim reap. They desire to see the fruit of their labor and so daily they watch and hope that the time will come for them to reap the harvest. I cannot plant today and hope to harvest tomorrow, there is a season for harvest and by us being planted by the river, we are watching and hoping that in due time, in our season we will bear the fruit. Your season may not be my season, your season of encouragement could be my season of discouragement but I know for sure that my time will come. Don&#8217;t be frustrated that someone else is enjoying their season, do all you need to do in your season and expect fruit in your own season. The bible says that this TOO SHALL PASS, seasons of depression, brokenness, fear, lack, will all pass. Not only do we bring fruit in our seasons, our leaf will not wither and what a blessing that is for people to look at you and say, &#8220;YOU ARE BLESSED&#8221;<br \/>\nAnd whatever he does shall prosper, God does give us instructions and tells us the end result when we do what He requires of us. In this case if we will meditate upon the law, be planted by the river, bring fruit in season and our leaf does not wither, whatever we do shall prosper. Being attached to a blessed river causes one to be blessed and everything he or she touches becomes blessed, your work will be blessed, your home, you family will be blessed I mean everything you do will just prosper and the word prosper I would say is a sign of abundance.<br \/>\nProverbs 10:32, &#8220;The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable&#8230;&#8221;, You and I know what is acceptable and what is required of us, let us be doers of the word not just hearers only deceiving ourselves.

How should we answer these people who say to me, `Lighten the yoke your father put on us&#8217;?&#8221; \u00a010 The young men who had grown up with him replied, &#8220;Tell these people who have said to you, `Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter&#8217;&#8211;tell them, `My little finger is thicker than my father&#8217;s waist. 11 My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.&#8217; &#8221; \u00a0 12 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, &#8220;Come back to me in three days.&#8221; 13 The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders, 14 he followed the advice of the young men and said, &#8220;My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.&#8221; 15 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite. \u00a016 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: &#8220;What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse&#8217;s son? \u00a0To your tents, O Israel! \u00a0Look after your own house, O David!&#8221; \u00a0So the Israelites went home.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Who do you seek advice from? \u00a0It&#8217;s interesting to note that Rehoboam went to two groups of people for advice, the elders (older men) and the young men (his contemporaries). \u00a0The elders told him what he needed to hear, while the young men told him what he wanted to hear. \u00a0The elders told him to grant the request of Israel, while the young men told him to lay the heavy yoke on Israel, over and above what Solomon laid upon them. \u00a0Even though ultimately this was the Sovereign will of God, just like Judas the betrayer, we should be careful who we take counsel from. Each of us needs advice at times, but who do you turn to? \u00a0I often advise teens not to go to other teens to help them with their problems for the most part, because their friends are going through the same things, but rather to those that are older who have gone through many of the issues that they face, just with &#8220;different clothing&#8221; if you will.

And I am convinced in our churches today, many people come to worship the God they know not. They may know about Him, but they have little or no understanding of who He is for they have not studied His word to know Him. How can we worship the true God and still believe there are many ways to God, or believe in evolution, or believe abortion or homosexuality is okay, or embrace gambling among other things that are contrary to who God is as revealed in His word?. Yes some people struggle in dealing and accepting them, which is different from someone who has acknowledged and given their seal of approval that they are ok. True worshipers know who their God is and what He requires of us.<\/p>\n<p>We see Paul encountering with Jews and Gentiles in Athens (Acts 17:16- ), people who were very religious, who were worshipers of idols and unknown gods. Yes they worshiped, but they did not worship the true God for He had not been introduced to them. They had zeal without knowledge. He says to them &#8220;vs. 22&#8230;Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious; 23 for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you:&#8221; Acts 17:22-23.<\/p>\n<p>This is where true worshipers of God the Father must worship in spirit and truth. These two go hand in hand; here the spirit does not mean Holy Spirit but human spirit, a willing heart. A willing heart must be accompanied by truth for true worship to occur. God has magnified His word above His name, I believe the reason is simple, that believers may learn the truth and turn their worship to Him in spirit and truth. This is why I love the preaching of the word, it exalts Christ and therefore worship the God of the Bible, rather than the god in my making or the god, I am comfortable with. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the divine word will not pass away, and in this respect, especially it has preeminence over every other form of manifestation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Preaching is not the end for those who are hearing, but the means to worship&#8221; Paul Washer. In Psalm 138:2 David says, &#8220;I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your loving kindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your word above all Your name&#8221;, The Lord had ordained a center of unity, a place of sacrifice, a house of His indwelling; and David accepted the way of worship enjoined by revelation of His word. Even so, the true hearted believer of these days must not fall into the will worship of superstition, or the wild worship of skepticism, but reverently worship as the Lord Himself prescribes in His word. The word is the means to an end where God is worshiped when Christ is exalted.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus preached the truth to the woman at the well. He did not spare the woman of her sin, He told her of her adulteress life exposing sin her life that in repentance she would finally worship the Holy and Just God,. We see the same with Paul proclaiming (preaching) to the Athenians, who in turn they would worship the Father in spirit and truth. Let us therefore adore the Lord who has spoken to us by His word, and by His Son; and in the presence of unbelievers let us both praise His holy name and extol His holy word. \u00a0Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 4:20-26, &#8220;22 You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. 24 God [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1967","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-vJ","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1967","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1967"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1967\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1968,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1967\/revisions\/1968"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1967"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1967"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1967"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1965,"date":"2010-10-01T19:12:22","date_gmt":"2010-10-01T13:42:22","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1965"},"modified":"2010-10-02T12:58:29","modified_gmt":"2010-10-02T07:28:29","slug":"a-true-worshiper-of-god-part-1-by-evans","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/10\/01\/a-true-worshiper-of-god-part-1-by-evans\/","title":{"rendered":"A True Worshiper Of God, Part 1, by&nbsp;Evans"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>John 4:20-26, &#8220;22 You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. 24 God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If you are like me, there are those times you sit and meditate on something profound you do or should do but never paid close attention to study it and go deeper as to why it&#8217;s done and how to explain it to others. I&#8217;ve been meditating on this for about a week now, what does it mean to be a worshipful person or be in a worship service. Not that I don&#8217;t know, the \u00a0better question I ask myself is, how can I articulate it to someone and make sense while I go deeper as I discover more of the mystery of worship.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure the worship of God is defined in Scripture, I see what it means to worship but I fail to find the definition in the scripture. From what I read, I find that it is not confined to praise; broadly it may be regarded as the direct acknowledgement to God, of His nature, attributes, ways and claims, whether by the outgoing of the heart in praise and thanksgiving or by deed done in such acknowledgment. Worship goes with worthiness, ascribing to God&#8217;s greatness. True worship service is where Christ is exalted in and through us by the Spirit of God. To quote my pastor, Gregg Johnson, &#8220;By His Spirit&#8230;For His glory&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In John 4 Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman at the well, teaching her among other things what true worship is. The required place, the geographical location had ceased to be of importance. Up to this point, the worship of God was associated with the temple, the tabernacle but Christ had come to do a new thing, He had come to make it clear what it meant to worship the true God. It was primarily the attitude of the people and how they met. The stress is not to be laid upon the place where we worship God, but upon the state of mind in which we worship Him. Here we see this woman say, &#8220;20, &#8220;Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.&#8221;. It was not about where but how, it was also not about outward appearance and actions, but something deeper than that. Vs 21, &#8220;Jesus said to her, &#8220;Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As creatures, we worship the Father of all: as Christians, we worship the Father of our Lord Jesus. Now the change shall be, in the nature of the worship. Christians shall worship God, not in the ceremonial observances of the Mosaic institution, but in spiritual ordinances, consisting less in bodily exercise, and animated and invigorated more with divine power and energy. The way of worship which Christ has instituted is rational and intellectual, and refined from those external rites and ceremonies with which the Old-Testament worship was both clouded and clogged&#8221;, Matthew Henry.<\/p>\n<p>My first point today in this devotion is to make it clear as Jesus did, it&#8217;s not where we worship that is important primarily (though it is important), it&#8217;s the attitude, the condition of the heart. It&#8217;s where in your heart, in your life Christ is exalted in and through you &#8220;by His Spirit&#8230;for His glory&#8221; above everything else in word, thought and deeds, to continue Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 4:20-26, &#8220;22 You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. 24 God [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1965","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-vH","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1965","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1965"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1965\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1966,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1965\/revisions\/1966"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1965"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1965"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1965"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1963,"date":"2010-09-30T18:36:11","date_gmt":"2010-09-30T13:06:11","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1963"},"modified":"2010-10-02T12:56:05","modified_gmt":"2010-10-02T07:26:05","slug":"prove-before-executing-by-evans","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/09\/30\/prove-before-executing-by-evans\/","title":{"rendered":"Prove Before Executing, by&nbsp;Evans"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Romans 12:2, &#8220;And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Anything that we do most of the time does not just affect one day but it affects the days to come. The more reason we need to be careful about what we plant in our lives &#8217;cause sooner or later, we will look back and see why it was good or bad to plant some things. Let me share briefly on three things I call CCD. These are CHOICES, CHANGES and DECISIONS. We are what we are because of the choices, changes and decisions we make.<\/p>\n<p>According to thesaurus, Choices are options, alternatives, selection, preference and pick. We can see that choices are not one thing or one plan; they are many things that give you and me a chance to pick from. Choosing is preferring one thing or a person to another. This is my theory; choices tend to start from the beginning where you choose what direction to take. The choices you and I make today will have the ability to affect our tomorrow. People choose based on the surrounding, situation, peers, the present and even more. Everyone has to make some type of choices in their lives, choosing who to marry, what kind of job you desire, what kind of house you want to live in etc<\/p>\n<p>Change is to alter, modify, vary, transform, revolutionize, adjust or amend. No one can say that they have no ability to change. There are two types of changes, the change that occurs in a person and the change a person can make. Change is as vital as Choice only that Chang allows you to improve a Choice made. The change can be big or small but everyone can see its significance. Changing your community begins with changes inside out to put aside what you don&#8217;t normally do and begin to develop a mindset of desiring to do it anyway, making it better. The change is not suppose to make it worse but better. Couples ought to change inside to make their marriages better and then using their change inside to change, perfect, revolutionize their marriage. Anyone who is not desiring to change is not ready for progress.<\/p>\n<p>Last but not least, &#8220;Decisions&#8221;. Decisions sound like choices and it is, but I look at choice as the beginning before anything happens while decisions are made in the middle of something and now a mind has to be made up. Decisions is making judgment, assessing the situation and making a resolution to it.<\/p>\n<p>All these three have one thing in common, they improve. Paul writes to the Romans and he is giving them guidelines to help them exercise these three things. One, &#8220;Do not be conformed to this world&#8221;, meaning do not try and copy the life style of this world to effectively bring these three to life because the world has set it&#8217;s standard on how to view them. Second, &#8220;But be transformed by the renewing of your mind&#8221;, Choices, changes and decisions are not made on emotions as many do; they are based on clear minds. It&#8217;s easy to do things without thinking and it affects us in the long run, but when our minds are renewed, they become in tune with our hearts, and with that we are ready to progress. &#8220;That you may prove what is that good and acceptable&#8221;, the three has to be approved, for example, when the manufacturers make any thing, they are not quick to bring it to the market, they prove it, test it, asses it to make sure it works well. They do not just look at what it can do today, they look at how long it will last, can it be effective, will it serve the purpose and so is with Christians, we have to prove what is that good, but by whose standards? Men&#8217;s or God&#8217;s? God&#8217;s standards are acceptable because it&#8217;s based on His perfect will.<\/p>\n<p>We can make Choices, Changes and Decisions based on what is proved to be good and acceptable and perfect will of God. What choices are you making today? what changes have you purposed to make? What decisions do you have to make?

This is why we should never cease to pray, &#8220;Lord, what is thy will in this or that?&#8221; We sometimes become selfish in our prayers that we only pray about things that are temporal rather than things that matters the most. Everything in our lives ought to serve to advance His kingdom rather than ours. Therefore to be in God&#8217;s will is to understand that all works for His purpose regardless of how things are turning.<\/p>\n<p>In reading Genesis 37, we see Joseph dreams shattered when first his brother&#8217;s wanted to kill him but then changed their minds and threw him in a pit only to sell him later. God&#8217;s sovereign and providential hand was upon Joseph. He directed all plans whether good or bad. That everything about this young man was going to serve His purpose.<\/p>\n<p>He sent a man before them (his family), even Joseph. He was the advance guard and pioneer for the whole clan. His brothers sold him, but God sent him. Where the hand of the wicked is visible, God&#8217;s hand may be invisibly at work, overruling their malice. Consider him sold into Egypt, not without the determinate counsel of God, who preordained this to good; &#8220;God did send me before you to preserve life, &#8220;Genesis 45:5. There was a great famine preordained by God, but God prepped 17 year old Joseph to preserve and deliverer His people as the Israelite seed. He only understood his mission when he met his brothers.<\/p>\n<p>God blessed others because of him, gave him dreams and revelation for others but not for himself and his situation. Regardless of what he did not get, you see a trail of trust in his God in every situation, perhaps reflecting on the life of great grandfather Abraham known as the father of faith \u00a0 Vs. 19. &#8220;Until the time that his word came&#8221;. God has his times, and his children must wait &#8220;until&#8221; it is fulfilled. Joseph was tried as in a furnace, until the Lord&#8217;s assaying work was fully accomplished. He believed the promise, but his faith was sorely exercised. A delayed blessing tests men, and proves their metal, whether their faith is of that precious kind which can endure the fire. &#8220;&#8230;The word of the LORD tested him. \u00a0The testing word that strengthens is also the delivering word that keeps. There is a trying word and a delivering word, and we must bear the one till the other comes to us. How meekly Joseph endured his afflictions, and with what fortitude he looked forward to the clearing of his slandered character we may readily imagine: it will be better still if under similar trials we are able to imitate him, and come forth from the furnace as thoroughly purified as he was, and as well prepared to bear the yet harder ordeal of honor and power. The word tested his character in readiness for his position. &#8220;Charisma can put anyone on top, its only character that will keep him on top Those who are tested by the fire of word often maintain character for faithfulness has been found in them.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one thing to go through something and know when and how you will come through it. Its another thing to hold on to what you know to be the truth because you know it&#8217;s serving God&#8217;s purpose either in your life or others even when you don&#8217;t know the outcome or what you will have to go through to keep you there. What are you trusting God for today? Is your prayer more of, &#8220;God let everything that you ordain in my life either good or bad (in my eyes) work for your own purpose.

Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?<\/p>\n<p>After bringing us through the glorious teaching of justification by faith in the last three chapters of his epistle to the Roman church, Paul now brings us a step farther in his teaching and doctrine, the death of sin in the life of the believer. In two short sentences he brings to an end so much lawless teaching which false teachers of our day have propagated, that willful sin is ok in the life of a Christian. He goes on to tell us that we should no longer be slaves of sin, to reckon ourselves dead indeed unto sin, to not let sin reign in our mortal bodies, and twice he states that we have been set free from sin. Friends, I tell you in all assurance, we are called unto holiness, to walk as Christ walked (I John 2:6) in this life.<\/p>\n<p>Sin is not to be tolerated in our lives, it is not suppressed, it is not ignored, it is not put up with, it is certainly not lived in, it is to be killed. The presence of sin does not make us humble, such a thought is foolishness as it aims to make a necessary occupant out of the very intruder of our souls that Jesus died to evict. Hebrews 12:14 says,&#8221; Pursue peace with all men, and holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord.&#8221; Here is the true necessity of our souls, to be holy as He is holy (I Peter 1:16), for it is necessary for our entrance into Heaven. Ephesians 5:27 speaks of the true church of Christ, one that is &#8220;holy and without blemish&#8221;, this is the church that Jesus is soon to return for.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus Christ died, not to save us in our sin, but to save us from our sin, to give to each one, as we consecrate our lives to Him by faith, surrendering ourselves to Him as living sacrifices, complete victory over the sinful nature that plagues us. However, we must yield to Him by faith, we must be willing. We must desire a clean heart as David did (Psalm 51), a heart in every thought renewed and full of love divine, a love that is perfect and pure and that desires God above all things. I pray that each would hear me in this, for I speak as one who struggled horribly, and one whose eyes the Holy Spirit opened to a better way, a way of holiness, a life of faith totally dependent on Christ and free of sinful desire, a life where God is loved and cherished above all things (Mark 12:30). There is victory this day in Jesus beloved, there is victory in the cross. There is no need to struggle any longer, there is a way out of the prison you are in this day. Surrender fully to the Lordship of Jesus, ask Him to reveal your heart, and be willing to give to Him all that He asks. Evans shared on prayer recently, and it is in the place of secret prayer with God that He will reveal His truth to our hearts, and bring us into a deeper place with Him, uniting us to Him by faith, making us partakers of His holiness by the instantaneous workings wrought in the heart by His Holy Spirit, establishing us blameless in Him (Hebrews 12:10, I Thess. 3:13). In closing, I share Paul&#8217;s prayer for the church at Thessalonica (I Thess. 5:23-24),&#8221; Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify (to free from sin and make holy) you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless AT the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Yours in the love and service of our Savior, \u00a0blessings Brother Ben<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 6:1-2- What shall we say then?

Anyone can start a journey, it matters a lot how you finish. I notice the way David begins strong and finishes strong. We see his hope rises, and his faith is strengthened, by being exercised. Observe what he promises himself, goodness and mercy. All the streams of mercy flowing from the fountain, pardoning mercy, protecting mercy, sustaining mercy, supplying mercy will follow him as he lives in obedience according to the one who has called him. He knows his total dependency is on God of host. There is nothing he ca do of himself but trust and obey. In talking about goodness, I find this hymn beautifully fitting with what David encourages us with. &#8220;When we walk with the Lord in the light of His word, what a glory He sheds on our way! While we do His good will, He abides with us still, and with all who will trust and obey. Chorus, &#8220;Trust and obey, for there&#8217;s no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey&#8221;, You trust and obey, goodness and mercy shall follow you. At our leadership retreat this weekend, my pastor said something striking to me, &#8220;God leads, we obey, He supplies&#8221;(paraphrased), not the other way round.<\/p>\n<p>Goodness supplies our needs, and mercy blots out our sins. Exodus 33:19, &#8220;And the LORD said, &#8220;I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. Psalm 33:5, &#8220;He loves righteousness and justice; The earth is full of the goodness of the LORD&#8221;, Romans 2:4, &#8220;&#8230;knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;.And I will dwell in the house of the LORD Forever&#8221;. In his conclusion, he talks about dwelling in the house of the Lord. This means not mean, stopping by or passing by but rather living in the house of the Lord. It even has a deeper meaning, it&#8217;s dwelling IN the Lord. We are housed in the Lord everywhere we go. He is the foundation and the builder on His foundation, we dwell in what He has built. Listen to David in Psalm 84: 1 How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD Almighty! 2 My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. 3 Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may have her young a place near your altar, O LORD Almighty, my King and my God. 4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house; they are ever praising you. 5 Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on pilgrimage. 6 As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools. 7 They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion. 8 Hear my prayer, O LORD God Almighty; listen to me, O God of Jacob. 9 Look upon our shield, O God; look with favor on your anointed one. 10 Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked. 11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor; no good thing does he withhold from those whose walk is blameless. 12 O LORD Almighty, blessed is the man who trusts in you&#8221;.

James 1:17, &#8220;Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over&#8221;. The sign of the anointing is when you can take less and do much with it. This is where we constantly need the filling of the Holy Spirit in order to live a Spirit filled life. At the time of Salvation, the Lord gives us Holy Spirit as down payment, daily we seek the filling for out pouring. Immersed in what we are filled with. &#8220;May we live in the daily enjoyment of this blessing, receiving a fresh anointing for every day&#8217;s duties. Every Christian is a priest, but he cannot execute the priestly office without unction, and hence we must go day by day to God the Holy Ghost, that we may have our heads anointed with oil.&#8221; Charles Spurgeon. We are completely dry and helpless without the anointing. &#8220;In the East the people frequently anoint their visitors with some very fragrant perfume; and give them a cup or glass of some choice wine, which they are careful to fill till it runs over. The first was designed to show their love and respect; the latter to imply that while they remained there, they should have an abundance of everything. To something of this kind the psalmist probably alludes in this passage.&#8221; Samuel Burder 2 Timothy 1:14, &#8220;That good thing which was committed to you, keep by the Holy Spirit who dwells in us&#8221; which mostly are, &#8220;oil of gladness&#8221; and the &#8220;joy of the Holy Ghost.&#8221;. what we&#8217;ve received, lets not only keep it to ourselves, may we trust God to touch other lives through what He has given to us. As John Trapp says, &#8220;He had not only a fullness of abundance, but of redundancies. Those that have this happiness must carry their cup upright, and see that it overflows into their poor brethren&#8217;s emptier vessels&#8221;.

We talk about &#8220;walking with the Lord&#8221;, it calls us to be nomads because the Lord is not stagnant or stationed in one place, neither should we. In this walk we constantly draw strength from Him. In this journey like the Psalmist, we may &#8220;walk through the valley of the shadow of death&#8221;. Mark that it does not say &#8220;walk in&#8221; but &#8220;walk through&#8221; that is, though you may be in peril of death, in the midst of danger, deep as a valley, dark as a shadow, and dreadful; \u00a0though you are under the arrest of death, and have received the sentence of death within yourself, and have all the reason in the world to look upon yourself as a dying person yet you are at ease fearing no evil for He is with you right where you are. This is one of the greatest comfort a believer can have in the valley of the shadow of death as he goes through it. God spoke to Joshua after the death of Moses saying, &#8220;5 No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you., 9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go&#8221;, Joshua1:5,9. If you look at the life of Joshua, it was not a stagnant life, he would have his own experience in the valley of the shadow of death, he needed God&#8217;s assurance.<\/p>\n<p>The shadow may be the terror of the enemy by night, but Someone has said that when there is a shadow there must be light somewhere. The presence of the Lord (the light) is realized \u00a0when shadow presents it self. That ought to be our comfort that we have enough proof of His presence. Psalm 94:19, &#8220;In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>God took away the sting of death when Christ died on the cross and resurrected. 1Coritnthians 15:54, &#8220;&#8230;written: &#8220;Death is swallowed up in victory.&#8221;55 &#8221; O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?&#8221; 1 John 5:12, &#8220;He who has the Son has life&#8221; even through the valley. This is not a temporary life for believers. Charles Spurgeon said, &#8220;Nobody is afraid of a shadow, for a shadow cannot stop a man&#8217;s pathway even for a moment. The shadow of a dog cannot bite; the shadow of a sword cannot kill; the shadow of death cannot destroy us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me&#8221;. A great reminder of who is in charge; the one with the rod and staff in His hands. It may not look like it&#8217;s much to battle and bring victory. It&#8217;s not the rod that matters, it&#8217;s in whose hands it is that matters. It&#8217;s not the rod that delivered the Israelites from Egypt, it&#8217;s God represented in that rod that did. They called it, &#8220;&#8230;the rod of God in his hand&#8221;, Exodus 4:20. Matthew Henry, &#8220;The gospel is called the rod of Christ&#8217;s strength (Ps. 110:2), and there is enough in that to comfort the saints when they come to die, and underneath them are the everlasting arms.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Divine Shepherd is in control right even in the valley. He is everywhere Psalm 139:1, &#8220;O LORD, You have searched me and known me. 2 You know my sitting down and my rising up; You understand my thought afar off. 3 You comprehend my path and my lying down, And are acquainted with all my ways.4 For there is not a word on my tongue, But behold, O LORD, You know it altogether. 5 You have hedged me behind and before, And laid Your hand upon me. 6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain it. 7 Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? 8 If I ascend into heaven, You are there; If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there. 9 If I take the wings of the morning, And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, 10 Even there Your hand shall lead me, And Your right hand shall hold me. 11 If I say, &#8220;Surely the darkness shall fall] on me,&#8221; Even the night shall be light about me; 12 Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You, But the night shines as the day; \u00a0The darkness and the light are both alike to You&#8221;, to continue.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 23: 4 , &#8220;Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me&#8221;.

While sanctification is being saved from the Power of sin. Glorification is being saved from the Presence of sin. Believers are currently in the stage of sanctification (purification), where God is working in us. It&#8217;s the pruning process and the Jeremiah 18 experience in the potter&#8217;s house.<\/p>\n<p>Sanctification level sometimes calls for restoration. The bible says that, whom the Lord loves, He corrects, Proverbs 3:12, Hebrews 12:6. He corrects the one who goes astray because He loves Him. If you are a parent and you discipline your child because of what they have done wrong, it&#8217;s not an indication that you hate them, you love them to want to restore value, dignity, respect etc, that is what restores is all about. Psalm 23:3, &#8220;He restores my soul; &#8230;&#8221; What is restoration? To bring back to a former, original, or normal condition. \u00a0Sometimes you will go through dry periods, change of things but if you belong to Him, He will restore you because He loves you. Restoration may be painful but you know it is vital. Isaiah 40:29, &#8220;He gives power to the weak, And to those who have no might He increases strength. 30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, \u00a0And the young men shall utterly fall, 31 But those who wait on the LORD Shall renew their strength; They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, They shall walk and not faint&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>No creature will lose itself sooner than a sheep, easy for it to go astray without on it&#8217;s own finding the way back. The best saints are sensible of their proneness to go astray like lost sheep (Psalm. 119:176); they miss their way, and turn aside into by-paths; but when God shows them their error, gives them repentance, and brings them back to their duty again, He restores their soul. If He does not do so, they would wander endlessly and be undone. In Jeremiah 18:4, says, &#8221; And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make.&#8221; We sometimes get marred in the hands of the potter, broken, we lose direction, focus, and effectiveness. The potter cannot be blamed for the injury. Here is the part I love, &#8220;&#8230;so he made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make.&#8221; The potter did not throw away the marred clay, He restored the clay to what He had in mind; a vessel. And no one makes a vessel if he has nothing to put in it. This is the reason none of us are in this world by accident regardless of how we may have been conceived. The Lord is not intimidated with the scars of the clay. He knows that the difference between what it is and what it shall be is His hands. Only He can bring it back. \u00a0He recovers you when you are sick, and revives you when you faint, and so restores your soul which is ready to depart. Many are the times we should have fainted but we did not because we believed; and it was the good shepherd that kept us from fainting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name&#8217;s sake&#8221;, what is the purpose of restoration? To keep walking the sanctified life for His glory. It&#8217;s more than feel good; it&#8217;s about living to honor His name, the desire and strength to live that life all comes from Him. Our prayer ought to be, &#8220;Lord we want to be a vessel of honor, living and representing you as Your ambassadors in this world, lead us in the path of righteousness, the righteousness we desperately need and the righteousness the world desperately needs for Your glory and honor. &#8220;For his name&#8217;s sake. Seeing he hath taken upon him the name of a &#8220;Good Shepherd&#8221;, he will discharge his part, whatever his sheep be. It is not their being bad sheep that can make him leave being a &#8220;Good Shepherd&#8221;, but he will be &#8220;good&#8221;, and maintain the credit of &#8220;his name&#8221; in spite of all their badness; and though no benefit come to them of it, yet there shall glory accrue to him by it, and &#8220;his name&#8221; shall nevertheless be magnified and extolled.&#8221; Sir Richard Baker.

Of course there is more to it than our physical needs. If anything, His daily word ought to be the green pasture we would focus on, to feed on and to rest on His promises. A section of the Lord&#8217;s prayer says, &#8220;give us this day our daily bread&#8221;, this is in line with God&#8217;s provision and what better provision would we desire primarily but His word. Everything else ties to the priority of His word.

It is milk for babes, pasture for sheep, never barren, never eaten bare, never parched, but always a green pasture for faith to feed in. God makes his saints to lie down; he gives them quiet and contentment in their own minds, what ever their lot is; their souls dwell at ease in him, and that makes every pasture green. God&#8217;s grace is sufficient, in other words, it&#8217;s more than enough (green). God&#8217;s mercies are ever new every morning, (ever fresh).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;He leads me beside the still waters&#8221;, notice that the Devine Shepherd does not order or give instructions and let the sheep decide, no, He leads. He is a head guiding His sheep in the right place at the right time. Matthew Henry says, &#8220;Those that feed on God&#8217;s goodness must follow His direction; He leads them by His providence, by His word, by His Spirit, disposes of their affairs for the best, according to His counsel, disposes their affections and actions according to His command, directs their eye, their way, and their heart, into his love&#8221;. He doesn&#8217;t&#8217; lead us in the path of by hurricane, flood or anything that brings about destruction, He leads us by still waters for He is gentle, He is meek. Matthew Henry, &#8220;The consolations of God, the joys of the Holy Ghost, are these still waters, by which the saints are led, streams which flow from the fountain of living waters and make glad the city of our God. God leads His people, not to the standing waters which corrupt and gather filth, not to the troubled sea, nor to the rapid rolling floods, but to the silent purling waters; for the still but running waters agree best with those spirits that flow out towards God and yet do it silently&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Those who are His sheep He will make and Lead them for they are humble and in submission to Him.

Many of David&#8217;s psalms are full of complaints, but this is full of comforts, and the expressions of delight in God&#8217;s great goodness and dependence upon him. In this Psalm, David pictures the Lord not as a doctor or lawyer or employer, he pictures the Lord as a shepherd, something he was once. He draws from his experience in tending to the sheep where he would do anything for his sheep and in that reality trusting the Lord to be to him what he was to his sheep, a shepherd.<\/p>\n<p>Who is a shepherd? This is a person who tends, feeds or guards flocks of sheep. A shepherd deals with a lot if you think about it. As you can see, he tends to the sheep, he feeds, he guards, he protects, he inspects, he knows if there is something wrong with his sheep, he is loving, caring, faithful, hard working, skillful; if one is missing, he leaves the rest to look for the one. Other occupations if I may say may have limitations of what they can and cannot do, a shepherd is a well rounded job.<\/p>\n<p>If the Lord was to be David&#8217;s shepherd, that would default David to be a sheep. For the sake of the Lord, I would take this position every day of the week and twice on Sunday. The sheep cannot take care of themselves, they need a shepherd so do we. I don&#8217;t know how people can live their lives without a shepherd. King David needed one, what about us? He who has a shepherd shall not be in want because the shepherd provides what He needs. Which sheep do you see worried when the shepherd is present? Yet sometimes we worry and live in fear as though we had no Shepherd.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus calls Himself the good shepherd. I would like to highlight 4 areas He mentions in John 10 that makes Him stand tall and unique. 1.He is the door of the sheep, John 10:7, &#8220;Then Jesus said to them again, &#8220;Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. 2. He gives life to His sheep, John 10:11, &#8220;&#8221;I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep.&#8221; \u00a0 3. He knows His sheep and He teaches them to know Him John 10:3, the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. Vs 14, &#8220;I am the good shepherd; and I know My sheep, and am known by My own. 4. He gives His life to His sheep, John 10:15 As the Father knows Me, even so I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep<\/p>\n<p>From three very comfortable promises in this Psalm, David draws three very comfortable conclusions, and teaches us to do so too. We are saved by hope, and that hope will not make us ashamed, because it is well grounded. It is the duty of Christians to encourage themselves in the Lord their God; and we are here directed to take that encouragement both from the relation wherein He stands to us and from the experience we have had of His goodness according to that relation.<\/p>\n<p>The Lord is to us what no man can ever be to us, the Devine Good Shepherd.

People who don&#8217;t treat prayers as secondary, what you do when it&#8217;s convenient or only when there is a need; but you put it as priority because your life depends on it. Those who&#8217;ve learnt the secret prep themselves daily through it. Martin Luther said, &#8220;I have so much to do that I shall spend the first three hours in prayer&#8221; In our time we say, &#8220;wee are too busy today to pray?<\/p>\n<p>How would you pray if you were in a lion&#8217;s den? Out of desperation would be my thought. You wouldn&#8217;t fall a sleep and it wouldn&#8217;t be cute nice little prayer. Daniel, in chapter 6 was desperate for the move of God, he therefore prayed desperate prayer and so was Jonah 3 days in the belly of a whale, Jonah 2:2, &#8220;&#8230; he said:&#8221; I cried out to the LORD because of my affliction, And He answered me. &#8220;Out of the belly of Sheol I cried, And You heard my voice. Hannah was desperate for a child that would one day glorify God. Upon being confronted by Eli (because Eli thought she was either going crazy or drunk) she told him, 1 Samuel 1:15, &#8230;, &#8220;No, my lord, I am a woman of sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor intoxicating drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD&#8221;. King Hezekiah was in distress for he was faced with a challenge, 2 Kings 19:3, &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;Thus says Hezekiah: &#8216;This day is a day of trouble, and rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth&#8221;, How can I forget King Jehoshaphat who when faced with great armies set up a prayer and fast meeting to seek God&#8217;s help, 2 Chronicles 20:3 &#8220;And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. 4 So Judah gathered together to ask help from the LORD; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD&#8221;. There are countless people in the bible who prayed desperate prayers because they desperately needed God. Again, desperate people do desperate things.<\/p>\n<p>While the disciples struggled to pray in the garden of Gethsemane, you see a dramatic change in their lives and ministry in the book of Acts. On the day of Pentecost, Acts 2 they were in one accord praying and waiting for the infilling of the Holy Spirit. Prayer became priority in their lives and in their ministry.<\/p>\n<p>Acts 6:4, &#8220;But we will give ourselves to prayer, and to the ministry of the word&#8221;, when you talk about prayers, the book of Acts is loaded with the word &#8220;prayer&#8221; and it&#8217;s simply because the early church devoted themselves to prayer, fasting, breaking of bread and fellowship that&#8217;s the reason why the early church was powerful and effective. When they became busier, they did not allow a shift to take place, they set everything to work around their prayers and ministry. They gave themselves to this cause. People of today want to see God move and yet do not want to pray like we should, I am guilty of this too. If we want to see God move, see sinners saved, see the sick get healed, marriages restored, children protected, teenagers live right, we got to pray. Look at what Acts 6:4 puts it, &#8220;But we will give ourselves to prayers, and to the ministry of the word&#8221;. Let&#8217;s give ourselves to prayers, praying everywhere, seeking the kingdom of God, praying thy Kingdom come, His will be done and praying for other people, pray in submission. 2Chronicles 7:14, &#8220;If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and forgive their sins and heal their land&#8221;. Read some of the quotes of men God used down through the ages who mightily depended on prayers &#8220;You can do more than pray after you&#8217;ve prayed, but you cannot do more than pray until you have prayed. &#8211; John Bunyan. &#8220;Prayer is the greatest of all forces, because it honors God and brings him into active aid&#8221;, E.M. Bounds. &#8220;Only turning God&#8217;s house into a house of fervent prayer will reverse the power of evil so evident in the world today&#8221;. Jim Cymbala. &#8220;He who knows how to overcome with God in prayer has heaven and earth at his disposal&#8221;, \u00a0C. S. Spurgeon. &#8220;God uses prayer to educate His people and to produce holiness of character in them&#8221;, Harold Lindsell. &#8220;No man &#8211; I don&#8217;t care how colossal his intellect &#8211; No man is greater than his prayer life.&#8221; &#8211; Leonard Ravenhill. Many times when we talk about such men, we talk about the results yet we have no clue of the Gethsemane experience where visions, burdens, agony, anguish, desperation, distress all began and had to devote themselves to the call to pray if they were to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>We better start praying today, give ourselves to prayers. Do you have a burden from the Lord birthed in the garden? Pray to the Lord to give you strength to carry it through in prayers. Are you lacking a burden? Then meet Him the garden not in horizontal position but vertical position. 1Timothy 2:8, &#8220;I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting&#8221;. \u00a0Blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Acts 6:4, &#8220;But we will give ourselves to prayer, and to the ministry of the word&#8221; Desperate people do desperate things and I&#8217;ve come to learn that God answers desperate prayers.

Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The time is now to slip away lay before the Lord and seek Him in prayer if we are going to stand. It&#8217;s the roots that keep the tree standing and it&#8217;s the life that gives the tree the fruit and it&#8217;s beauty.<\/p>\n<p>Matthew 26: 39 He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, &#8220;O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.&#8221; In agony and in distress, Knelt, falling on His face and prayed and what was His prayer, &#8220;O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will&#8221; this reveals how Christ in His humanity voluntary surrendered His will to the will of the Father in all things. This verse is not suggesting that there was conflict between the divine will and His desires. The will and the desire were in perfect harmony. Desiring the cup to pass is also not suggesting that Christ was afraid of the physical torments of the cross brought about by men. He was sorrowful because within hours the full cup of the divine fury against sin would be His drink. Carrying the weight of all sin of the world placed on Him. The [pressure was so heavy upon him, the cup was so bitter, the burden was so strange and intolerable, that the flesh cried out for relief. Even in all that He submitted to the will of God the Father knowing that whichever way the Father chose would bring the Father more glory.<\/p>\n<p>Obedience to and dependence upon God&#8217;s will summed up Jesus&#8217; whole life and at the garden all the way to the cross, you see it demonstrated. This is the reason why on our face we seek God in obedience and in submission to His will. How many times have I desired that the burden that sometimes may not involve me directly was passed to someone else? The heavy lifting in prayer, in anguish you wished someone else would take that burden. And right in the midst of it all you ask the Lord to lift it up but also you are opened to His will, which is, whatever brings Him more glory, let it be. Three times He prayed that the cup would pass, three times He yielded to the will of God. And the bible says, Luke 22:43 Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him. 44 And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground&#8221;. In total submission, an \u00a0angels came and strengthened Him. This was complete submission.. The influence of the divine nature withdrew for the present, and then, as to his human nature, He was for a little while lower than the angels, and was capable of receiving help from them and In that strengthening. Instead of being delivered from the cup, He was strengthened to drink from the cup and in agony He prayed more earnestly In 2 Corinthians 12:7-10, Paul had what he called a thorn in the flesh to keep him humble and submissive, &#8220;8 Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. 9 And He said to me, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.&#8221; Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ&#8217;s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong. \u00a0Paul desired relief in his distress too but also in obedience to and dependence upon God&#8217;s will, He submitted completely and was strengthened, and in that he rejoiced.<\/p>\n<p>Matthew Henry says, &#8220;Prayer, though never out of season, is in a special manner seasonable when we are in an agony; and the stronger our agonies are the more lively and frequent our prayers should be. Now it was that Christ offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears, and was heard in that He feared (Heb. 5:7), and in His fear wrestled, as Jacob with the angel.. That, in this agony, His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. Sweat came in with sin, and was a branch of the curse, Gen. 3:19.

Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The garden of Gethsemane experience was no ordinary experience, it was very intense. The disciples had seen Jesus in His glory as the Holy Spirit taking the shape of a dove descended on Jesus and the Father spoke of His Son. Then another time I recall vividly is the mount of transfiguration where Christ is transfigured and there appeared to Him Moses and Elijah and so was a voice from heaven. The three disciples Peter, James and John were very much present and very much awake. In this crucial time in the garden, heaven seamed silent, the Father did not appear to speak, you don&#8217;t sense the Holy Spirit&#8217;s presence, all hell is breaking loose as He submits, and the disciples who should stand with Him are weak to stand and pray in the hour of prayer.<\/p>\n<p>Matthew 26:37, &#8220;37 And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. 38 Then He said to them, &#8220;My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.&#8221;, He shares with them of His troubled heart as plainly as He could not for His sake but their sake and ours. What would a good friend do in a situation like that? I would say stand with the one who needs it the most. I believe Christ shared with them that they too would gain a burden and stand with Him. I&#8217;ve been thinking as I started studying this passage as to whether I&#8217;ve been brought in the garden of Gethsemane to experience what is the heart of our Savior Lord Jesus in our time. That if I was to lay my head on His chest and hear the heartbeat of what is in His heart for our time that I would be troubled too. And I would stand and say, Lord burden me too with what burdens you and bring me out of my normal regular praying to travailing, anguishing, agonizing prayers. Where I lost sleep or even lost appetite for food because my heart was so troubled and exceedingly sorrowful, even unto death because I have friends, family members, work mates who are not saved. Also for young people living in rebellion against God, parents, authorities, those who blasphemes the Lord&#8217;s name all day long, for the increasing divorce cases, immorality, and false teachers.<\/p>\n<p>Having such a great burden from the Lord that troubles His heart for this generation would be what troubles my heart for my generation too. This generation is responsible for this generation and we cannot fall asleep and expect God to move without stirring our hearts to labor with Him in a crucial time. It begins by being present in the garden (in the prayer closet). Ezekiel 22:30, &#8220;So I sought for a man among them who would make a wall, and stand in the gap before Me on behalf of the land, that I should not destroy it; but I found no one&#8221; Lord help us shake off our drowsiness, that we may be fit to pray, and pray for grace, that we may be able to shake off our drowsiness&#8221;. We&#8217;ve been awake and vibrant in the mount of transfiguration, let&#8217;s move to the garden of Gethsemane where He has called us to share with us what&#8217;s in His heart and labor with Him. Are we willing to move from our normal prayers to intense prayers because we know we are responsible for this generation?

Even men mightily used of God confess theirs struggle too.<\/p>\n<p>I want to submit to you that prayer is not reserved for church only. By that I mean, I don&#8217;t have to wait to go to church to pray and when I am out of the church, prayer ceases. Prayer daily is essential in our walk with God. Mark this word, &#8220;God does not need prayers to be \u00a0God, we need prayers to be like God (Jesus)&#8221;, we are His children.<\/p>\n<p>We don&#8217;t pray because we want to, we pray because we need to. When Jesus knew that His time for crucifixion was getting near, even began to prepare His disciples for the things that were coming a head of them. The very best was to tell Peter to be ready as the devil had desired to sift him and to assure him of His prayers for him. This was not just for Peter but for the rest of the disciples too. He had already warned them Peter in particular that an egregious trial was imminent. Sadly, that warning as well as His imploring them to pray, went unheeded. It did not burden them to do something about it. Those who are troubled don&#8217;t fall asleep. Those who are troubled will be in vertical position rather than horizontal position. They understand that it&#8217;s time to watch and pray.<\/p>\n<p>He went to the mountain to pray and He brought with Him Peter, James and John as usual, left them somewhere to pray while He went further to another division of the mountain to pray. He prayed earnestly, faithfully, agonizing and in anguish. It was an intense prayer time unlike other times. Matt 26:39, &#8220;Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak&#8221;. He understood that for these guys to stand during the trying times they were about to face, they needed to pray. He also knew that their spirit was willing but their flesh was too weak. Thank God that the willing spirit ought to concur the unwilling flesh to yield to what is needed the most in this crucial hour. The flesh does not like the idea of praying but it needs it to escape temptations, needs it for provision, guidance, protection to mention a few Coming back to check on his friends, He found them a sleep and asked, &#8220;What! Could you not watch with Me one hour? Matt 26:40&#8221;. Watch here means pray. It was a crucial moment, they were about to face some of the greatest challenges of their lives, they were at a crossroads.<\/p>\n<p>When I read the passage in Luke 22, I see a collective of things threatened the reason they needed to pray. If the Master was arrested as He would, 1. Their faith would be shaken to the point of denying Christ, they needed to pray. 2. Their unity was going to be in jeopardy. You take away the shepherd, the sheep would scatter; 3. Their prayer time would keep them solid in God&#8217;s will even in the midst of the trial a head of them. 4. They needed to pray to be strong.<\/p>\n<p>What is currently happening in the world ought to remind us that we are in a very crucial moment in life. The question is, are we watching and praying? I don&#8217;t see any hope outside praying. We can champion for morality all day long, support political activities that bring about change, rally against things that threatens, families, lives but without watching and praying, our labors are in vain.

Instead, we lift up religion and draw all men into an institution. Sinners today are presented with a Gospel that is decidedly in their favor. It is marketed and packaged the same way a salesman makes a sales pitch: it must answer the all important, universal question: &#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221; And the answer is salvation, the assurance of a home in heaven, deliverance, solutions to problems, peace, blessings from God, and so forth. Is that what the gospel is? \u00a0The death of Christianity will not be the result of everyone rejecting the Gospel, but the result of everyone accepting a watered-down, cold version of it.&#8221; \u00a0It will be like the polio vaccine, where they give you a weakened form of polio so your body builds antibodies up to fight the disease. \u00a0You get just enough polio to keep you from getting the real thing.<\/p>\n<p>Many have been given just enough religion, preaching, Bible stories, tradition, and church to keep them from the real thing. \u00a0All too often the object of salvation, its very purpose, is overlooked. Why should a sinner repent? Not for what he or she can get out of it, but for what the Lord Jesus gets out of it. Do we reach out to the world based on their own self-serving need, or based on the Lord&#8217;s Need? We are called to try and catch fish, His job is cleaning the fish.<\/p>\n<p>Christ less evangelism does not give anyone salvation, it only gives them the false assurance of salvation. The Church is supposed to make disciples for Christ, not record decisions for Christ. A decision does not necessarily make a disciple.<\/p>\n<p>Application: \u00a0Is your heart warm or cold towards reaching the lost? When trying to share the gospel do you leave out important parts, like God&#8217;s law, sin, death, hell, born-again, and conversion? \u00a0How will they know the truth, unless we show it to them (Rom 10:12-15).

No matter what you may say to ease the guilt of your sin, you must feel that same feeling I felt, and that&#8217;s the whisper of the Holy Spirit practically saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t fall for this, My word is right next to you. Run to me, not to sin!&#8221; Last night, I blatantly ignored the voice of the Holy Spirit to gratify a momentary feeling felt from natural standards, instead of strengthening myself spiritually. I did not have my mind set on what the Spirit desired! Masturbation, like any other addiction, can be overcome. Remember, in V. 10-11 Paul states, &#8220;But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness. And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you.&#8221; There is a reason why the Holy Spirit was telling me to read the Word instead of putting &#8220;confidence in the flesh&#8221; (Philippians 3:3). You are not strong enough to stand on your own. God&#8217;s word has the message that you need to defeat the enemy in the spiritual battle. Trust in the Lord, and He will bring you rest! God is good! Praise Him!<\/p>\n<p>1. Repent. Immediately after I fell, I did repent. However, and I must warn you. You have to be sincere in your repentance. Don&#8217;t let it be a string of routine words that you THINK God wants to hear. If that&#8217;s an issue for you, then I&#8217;d suggest silence and meditation on God&#8217;s word. God wants a broken spirit, and a broken and contrite heart. Turn a full 180 degrees away from your sin and walk in the truth of God&#8217;s word. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02. Confess. This part may be hard for some, but it&#8217;s extremely rewarding spiritually. In Foster&#8217;s book &#8220;Celebration of Discipline&#8221; he states how the power of confession is able to truly set you free from the darkness of your sin, and I agree. Think about it. Repenting in your room, the place of your darkness, where you fell, is extremely too comfortable. God wants us to truly be repentant. If you honestly feel the desire to live in the Spirit more than the flesh, go to the one whom the sin may hurt the MOST, and reveal to them your failure. Every time I fall to masturbation, I tell my girlfriend. It&#8217;s uncomfortable, but my darkness is revealed in the light of confession, and the Holy Spirit resonates within me with a peaceful forgiveness that I, nor we, truly deserve. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03. Persevere. After you&#8217;ve sought God&#8217;s forgiveness, it&#8217;s back on God&#8217;s path for us. This sin, my brothers, will creep up on you again. The enemy knows when you are weak, but praise God! Because when we are weak, HE is strong! Be prepared with the full armor of God (Helmet of Salvation, Breastplate of Righteousness, Belt of Truth, Shoes of the Gospel, Shield of Faith, and the Sword of the Word), and press on! Leave what is behind you and strain towards what is ahead! (Philippians 3:13)<\/p>\n<p>My brothers, how UNWORTHY we are of God&#8217;s love! We will never understand it&#8217;s complexities, but somehow, we are saved from the fire and chosen for God&#8217;s purpose. Remember, Paul understood as well in Ephesians 2:3, &#8220;All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.&#8221; But this was in our past, Amen! We are dead to sin and alive in Christ Jesus! Christ said in John 14:12 &#8220;I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.&#8221; Is your faith found in Christ, and is your desire to do what He did? Get back to basics brothers, and see where your faith lies. Is it in the computer that will always bring you another chance to masturbate? Or is it in God&#8217;s love who will always bring you another chance to be redeemed, made clean, and used for His will? Because, let me warn you. God can come back ANY SECOND. When He comes, what will you be doing? God forgive us if we are caught up during a sinful act! That thought alone brings shivers through my skin! Live expecting the Lord&#8217;s return to be NOW, and persevere through the temptations, and trials. God will meet us. I love you. Thank you for listening, and may He bless you.

Knowing God&#8217;s way is knowing Him and His style of doing things, knowing the timing, knowing that you can trust Him and even knowing that He has everything under control. The children of Israel only knew His acts in that any time God did not do something for them in a tough situation, they would murmur and complain. Moses led about 2.5 million people out of Egypt without an army and it&#8217;s because He knew God&#8217;s ways when many complained. People who do not know God&#8217;s ways will always be complainers, people on the verge of living by miracles and can&#8217;t see anything beyond that. They are people who have happiness when everything is going the right way. Their happiness depends on circumstances. When you know God&#8217;s ways, you will have joy, unspeakable joy full of the glory of God at all times. Joy does not depend on circumstance, joy goes with the fact that you know who is in charge. Therefore whether things are going right or wrong, I will still have the joy and not happiness. I don&#8217;t have to see it to trust Him; and I don&#8217;t have to have it to thank Him, I know in whom I have believed.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 86:11, &#8220;Teach me Your way, O Lord and I will walk in your truth: Unite my heart to fear Your name&#8221;. I love the way the psalmist puts it. Instead of him praying &#8220;show me your acts&#8221;, he asking to be taught God&#8217;s ways. He knows that learning God&#8217;s ways will keep him from being discouraged and broken when things don&#8217;t go his way. He says teach me to walk in Your truth to avoid living in deception, without killing my trust in You, without aborting what You have started in me even when I do see the acts. Knowing God&#8217;s ways will teach you to fear His name even more, He is God who completes His promises regardless of the time or the season. Psalm 119:105, &#8220;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path (way)&#8221;, The word of the Lord is the truth, John 14:6, &#8220;Jesus says unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life&#8221;, John 1:1, &#8220;In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God&#8221;, He is also the light, John 9:5, &#8220;As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world&#8221;. All these truths about Christ should lead us to trust Him and take Him at His word. His words are a lamp unto our feet, guiding us, directing us, showing us His ways. His light cannot go dim, it&#8217;s bright in the day and in the night, darkness cannot comprehend Him. When His light comes in, darkness has no choice but to leave. We live in a world full of darkness but God will shine His way for us.<\/p>\n<p>Psalms 25:4&amp;5, &#8220;Show me Your ways, O Lord; Teach me Your paths. Lead me in Your truth and teach me, For You are the God of my salvation On You I wait all the day&#8221;. Three key words in these two verses are significant. When He shows You His ways He has your eyes; when He teaches you His paths, He has your mind; and when He leads you in His truth, He has your hand. What more can one ask of the Lord than to know how God operates. I would prefer knowing His ways to knowing His acts. His ways will teach me how to call on Him, depend on Him and more so have an intimate relationship with Him. As for His acts, I will only look to Him when I need something and that will be it, I will not experience Him on a day to day basis because I will only see Him when He moves. &#8220;For You are the God of my salvation On You I wait all the day&#8221;. You and I can wait on God all day without being frustrated for He will show come (not that he left anyway). How I pray that we will begin by desiring to know His ways rather than His acts for greater weight lies on His ways.<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 25:9, &#8220;The humble will He guides in justice: and the humble He teaches His way&#8221;, The reason why God taught Moses His ways was because He was a humble man. He trusted him with over 2.5million for God knew that Moses would look to Him for help at any time of day or night. Moses could believe God for something that had not happened yet and He could also remain calm in tough situations, He trusted God&#8217;s ways.

The &#8220;they&#8221; who overcame refers to the believers, who despite the trials and tribulations they went through, stood their ground and used their weapons to overcome and destroy the power, will and evil strategies of Satan, so they could not be destroyed by him. The &#8220;him&#8221; is referring to Satan who was cast down from heaven and came down on earth full of hate, anger and determination to oppose God and to destroy the people of God as we see in the following Scriptures: &#8220;How art thou fallen from heaven, Oh Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which did weaken the nations!&#8221; Isaiah 14:12, &#8220;He comes to steal, kill and destroy&#8221; John 10:10. The mission of the devil is to defeat believers. He will do anything he can to achieve that goal. He hates the abundant life Christ has given us. He is terrified by the weapons we have been given to use against him, if we use them correctly. He schemes day and night to tear us apart. He threatens with fearful words. He yells at times. He intimidates with fear. He inflicts pain and hoping that we will surrender and turn away from our God. Left unchecked and uncomforted, Satan will do havoc in your life and will live you lead a miserable life, with the possibility of missing heaven. That is where he does not want the Christians to go to.<\/p>\n<p>How then can Christians confront this enemy of their soul and prosperity? What weapons can we use against him to defeat him? There are many things we can do and many weapons we can use, but there are some of the weapons of spiritual destruction he cannot resist: the blood of the Lamb and testimony. Today, I want to emphasize the importance of &#8220;testimony&#8221; as a weapon in the hands of a Christian, for overcoming any satanic attacks on your life and God ordained destiny. Your testimony is powerful. One, because its personal; it is an experience and it is a conviction and confession of what you know, believe and of what God has done in the past and can do again. The word testimony simply means confession. Saying what is or what you believe or know. The war between the devil and believers is mostly verbal. There is a lot of exchange of words. The strategy of the devil has not changed from Christ&#8217;s time. In the wilderness of temptation, he confronted Jesus with words (distorted quotation of scripture) hoping that he would destroy him. But, Jesus won by using a more powerful and truthful testimony of God&#8217;s word. He said, each time, &#8220;It is written&#8221; and quoted the truth. Satan was defeated by Christ&#8217;s testimony. He cannot stand the Bible truth. You too can defeat the devil by your testimony. When faced with a challenge, problem, pain, discouragement, confusion, temptation or trials and you feel threatened and overwhelmed, pull out your testimony. Remind yourself of the victories of the past God had given you. Remember how, for example, you got healed once; how you were encouraged once when you were terribly discouraged; how you got the job or marriage you have; how some of your prayers had been answered; how God has been good to you in the past. The doors of prosperity and advancement he has opened for you. The victories he has given you over big and small challenges. Talk about these things in the face of a challenge. It could be bad marriage, health problem, worries and anxiety, discouragement or depression. Or, it may be recurring failure or loss of joy, opportunity, property or relationship. Whatever the case or situation may be, give a powerful testimony of yesterday and a powerful confession that &#8220;God who did it then, He will do it again&#8221;. Don&#8217;t be intimidated by the threats of the devil. His words are powerful, yes, but your testimony is more powerful, and will overcome anything he tries to fashion against you. You can destroy him by the blood of the lamb and your testimony. Start to verbalize more of what God has done. Tell every circumstance in your life that God is great and is able and that you cannot be defeated by anything. That is exactly what David did when he faced the giant, Goliath. He was small but he did not let Goliath intimidate him and insult the Lord God of Israel. He remembered the victories God had given him in the past and from that remembering, he gained courage, strengthened himself against Goliath and went after him, knocked him down, cut off his head and brought his head to temple of God as a testimony and confirmation that he had overcome him by his testimony and the help of the Almighty God. You too can behead and hang the heads of all giants in your life on the walls of your heart and mind, as a testimony of your victory, won by the blood of the Lamb and the word of your testimony. Arise and testify! Overcome and testify again! Victory is yours!

Many people like you and I have faced situations that we wished we could run a way from and find rest somewhere else other than where we are or had been. In most cases, we always think of some better alternatives that may give us rest and happiness and help us to forget the pain we have been through with whatever it is that we are wishing to run a way.<\/p>\n<p>Wishing to run away from it all, when it is painful or unpleasant, to find rest elsewhere has been the desire of many. That is why many people have walked a way from places, abandoned their marriages or friendships or worse their faith in Christ. So, what should we do when we cannot take it anymore? Should we run away or fly away to some places where we can enjoy ourselves or cool or temporarily forget our misery or troubles? Should we desire to have wings to fly away? What kind of wings should we have? Where, really, should we escape to for rest?<\/p>\n<p>The Psalmist in Psalm 55:6 faced insurmountable problems and experienced sorrow, grief, disappointment and frustration to the point he wanted to fly from everything and from where he was to a different location for rest. Listen to what he said, &#8220;Oh, that I had wings like a dove! for then I would fly a way and be at rest'&#8221; We&#8217;ve all had that feeling! Perhaps you are feeling it right now-the desire to exit, the longing to escape from some painful difficulty or relationship, the urgency to somehow be lifted out of a problem that seems unsolvable. Whatever the situation may be, we always desire some alternative place where we can rest. Before we decide where to go, we had better understand what we mean by rest and where we can find that rest. Rest is a state of mind and the spirit. It is not geography. Hence, we cannot find it in some vacation resort or town, or even new relationship or new ventures. Genuine and lasting rest can be found in Jesus Christ only. He is constantly inviting us to come and find rest in Him&#8230;&#8221;Come unto me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest (Mathew 11:28) Rest, therefore, it&#8217;s not in some place or someone. Rest is found in the presence of God. Anyone who wants to experience God&#8217;s rest must learn not to escape but to come. His presence is right where you are. You can find rest without having to relocate, abandon, quit, divorce, or seek newer relationships. \u00a0Sometimes, instead of escaping, we need to change ourselves before we try to find rest elsewhere. Often, we are causers of the problems we are trying to escape. If we do not change, no matter where we escape to, we will carry ourselves with us. If our attitude is negative or cynical, we will relocate with it. If we are hateful and difficult to deal or communicate with, we are likely to move to our next relationship with the same personality. If we are fearful, arrogant or deceitful, chances are we are going to be the same in our next stop. Is relocating necessary? May be, but the most important thing to do, if we need rest from all our undesirable circumstances, is to come to God and ask him to change us first and then give us internal and eternal rest for our souls.<\/p>\n<p>Next time when you are overwhelmed like the Psalmist, do not seek to fly a way with the wings of a dove. Seek the presence of the Lord, and renew your strength. Then fly with wings like the eagle. Eagles fly higher and go further than the doves. Eagles are not easy to prey on. They are wise and calculate their moves. The eagles, at times, do not spend their energy flapping their wings, like the doves, when they are flying. They position themselves in the direction of the wind and the winds carry them. Let the winds of the Holy Spirit carry you today to His presence and be restful.<\/p>\n<p>Bblessings<\/p>\n<p>Boaz<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Have you ever been in a situation, relationship, place, or job you had hoped to give you joy or satisfaction or fulfillment or hope but instead turned out to frustrate you so much you needed an escape window?

Jesus is the vine and Christians are the branches which gives us a picture of the relationship He desires us to understand. \u00a0You see Jesus wants a flourishing family. \u00a0He could have picked up anything to illustrate His heart, like a sword, a bucket of water, but His chose grapes as His illustration. \u00a0Being hours from His death, Jesus wanted to leave a graphic picture of what He desired to come forth from the lives of the disciples, and that was fruit. \u00a0Christ desired to have His character developed in His followers, and for those followers to be fishers of men.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus said that &#8220;If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit.&#8221; \u00a0To bear Godly fruit one must be connected to God. One cannot produce Godly fruit any other way. \u00a0God created us to be fruit bearing, and not barren branches. \u00a0Consider the words by Christian song artist Rebecca St. James in her song &#8220;Me Without You.&#8221; \u00a0 Like a band without a drummer, That&#8217;s me without you. Like a year without a summer, That&#8217;s me without you. Like a king without a country. Like a room without a view; Like an empty gun, Like a fatherless son, That&#8217;s me without you, Like a ship without a rudder, That&#8217;s me without you; Like a child without a mother, That&#8217;s me without you; Like a story with no ending, Like a foot without a shoe; Like a wasted feast, Like a faithless priest; That&#8217;s me without you, \u00a0 Chorus: Me without you, A pitiful sight, Me without you, It ain&#8217;t never gonna feel right&#8230; Like a war without an enemy, That&#8217;s me without you; A disease without a remedy, That&#8217;s me without you; Like a crime without a victim, Like a sleuth without a clue; Like an empty gun, Like a fatherless son, That&#8217;s me without you, Without you&#8230; Repeat<\/p>\n<p>Do you feel hopeless and helpless without Christ? \u00a0Do you feel that you can truly live apart from Him? \u00a0He is my only bridge to heaven. \u00a0Eph 4:23-24 that you are &#8220;to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.. \u00a0Do you see you truly can&#8217;t put on the Lord Jesus Christ and separate yourself from Him? \u00a0We need Christ as bad as someone jumping out of an airplane needs a parachute.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this as well. \u00a0Two men are seated on a plane. The first is given a parachute and told to put it on as it would improve his flight. He&#8217;s a little skeptical at first, since he can&#8217;t see how wearing a parachute on a plane could possibly improve his flight. He experiments to see if the claims are true. As he puts it on, he notices the weight of it upon his shoulders and he finds he has difficulty in sitting upright. However, he consoles himself with the fact he was told that the parachute would improve his flight. So he decides to give it a little time. As he waits he notices that some of the other passengers are laughing at him for wearing a parachute on a plane. He begins to feel somewhat humiliated. As they continue to point and laugh at him, he can stand it no longer. He slinks in his seat, unstraps the parachute and throws it to the floor. Disillusionment and bitterness fill his heart, because as far as he was concerned he was told an outright lie.<\/p>\n<p>The second man is given a parachute, but listen to what he is told. He&#8217;s told to put it on because at any moment he&#8217;ll be jumping 25,000 feet out of the plane. He gratefully puts the parachute on. He doesn&#8217;t notice the weight of it upon his shoulders, nor that he can&#8217;t sit upright. His mind is consumed with the thought of what would happen to him if he jumped without the parachute. Instead of preaching, or thinking that Jesus improves the flight, we should be warning sinners and being aware that all will jump out of the plane. &#8220;It&#8217;s appointed for man to die once and then face judgment (Hebrews 9:27). \u00a0The issue isn&#8217;t one of happiness, but one of righteousness. \u00a0Can you really live apart from Christ and have a fruitful life of righteousness, or have you accepted His words, &#8220;Apart from me you can do nothing?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Application: Think about it.

The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession.&#8221; \u00a0 \u00a0By breaking this verse into its 3 natural parts, I believe we can discover a small slice of what it means to be chosen by God.<\/p>\n<p>A \u2013 \u2018Your are a people holy to the Lord your God.&#8221; \u00a0 This relates to our position found in Christ. As a child of God, He sees you not as unworthy, guilty, dirty or unusable, but forgiven, wonderfully created, and full of purpose! \u00a0 1 Pet. 2:9-10, further elaborates that God has chosen us to be His people to declare to the dark world that Jesus is alive and wants the world to live in His light. \u00a0What a great feeling to know that God has not only made us pure in His blood, but has given us a mission to help turn the lost to Him (2 Cor. 5:18-21). \u00a0You have hope of living a victorious, overcoming life, claim your identity as a child of God, separated from the sin that so easily entangles you.<\/p>\n<p>B &#8211; \u00a0&#8220;The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the people of the earth to be His people.&#8221; This relates to your identity. \u00a0Many times we struggle with a sense of belonging or feeling accepted in a cold world. However, when we begin to think on the fact that we not only belong to God, but we are a part of the greatest group in the world, the Body of Christ, we can take comfort. \u00a0We have been selected to be key members in Christ&#8217;s Army. \u00a0Some past and present members of this team include such hero&#8217;s as Joshua, Moses, David, D.L. Moody and Billy Graham. \u00a0Add your name to that list as you take your place in building the Kingdom of God today. \u00a0While, we may not be chosen to receive earthly rewards, the result of being chosen by God will result in rewards that far outweigh any that this world can offer!<\/p>\n<p>C- \u00a0(You are) &#8220;His treasured possession&#8221; &#8211; This relates to His love and relationship with you. \u00a0We all have things that we treasure from important pictures to certain outfits. \u00a0God considers us His treasure. He wants to invest that treasure (you) to bring riches (blessings, healing, joy) to the lost from which the enemy has stolen. \u00a0As His treasure, He values your life and wants to invest Himself in You. \u00a0How? He invests in us as we seek to build a relationship with Him by looking in His treasure chest (Word of God) and listening to His treasured words (prayer, meditation of scripture, preaching of the Word). There is nothing more valuable to God than You. \u00a0That&#8217;s why He sent Jesus. That&#8217;s why He has chosen you out of the entire world to represent Him to a dying world. That&#8217;s why He created you in His image, with a personality and gifts unlike those of anyone else in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Nik<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Have you ever been selected or chosen to do something special in your life? \u00a0When I was a teenager, I remember trying out for a spot on an important baseball team in our area. \u00a0Many other teenagers were also competing for a small number of open spots. \u00a0Shortly after the tryouts ended, the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1920","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-uY","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1920","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1920"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1920\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1921,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1920\/revisions\/1921"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1920"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1920"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1920"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1917,"date":"2010-08-27T18:33:14","date_gmt":"2010-08-27T13:03:14","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1917"},"modified":"2010-09-04T21:19:58","modified_gmt":"2010-09-04T15:49:58","slug":"why-we-serve-christ-by-evans","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/08\/27\/why-we-serve-christ-by-evans\/","title":{"rendered":"Why We Serve Christ, by&nbsp;Evans"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>1Peter 3:15, &#8220;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense (reason) to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We appreciate messages on life enhancements, steps to happiness, how to live a successful life, how to prosper and the like. These messages are good and we should love them but the messages on holiness, righteousness, purity, sanctification, concentration, servant hood should have a greater impact in a life of a believer. The Benefactor ought to be greater than the benefits. \u00a0Christ is the PRIME product so to speak, not the by product<\/p>\n<p>A weak example I can use that might drive this point home is this, If you apply for a job in a company, the main thing is not the benefits but the job itself. \u00a0As you discuss the nature of the job, the requirements, the salary, the environment, the expectations somewhere in between you will discuss the benefits. I don&#8217;t think that anyone applies for a job primarily for benefits. With this in mind, the first question I ask myself, why I&#8217;m I serving Christ? Why did I come to Christ?. I believe that our understanding of why we serve Christ helps eliminates many things that we get frustrated with when we have a clear understanding of why we chose or better, why Christ chose us in the first place. Did I come to serve because He promised me life enhancement, happiness, comfort? Why are you serving Christ?<\/p>\n<p>I came to Christ primarily because He offered eternal life and bring glory to His name. Hebrews 9:27, says &#8220;And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this is judgment&#8221; and His judgment will not be based on the life enhancement, it will be based on whether I repented of my since and received Christ by faith. If coming to Christ is to receive the gift of eternal life, then serving Christ is to maintain the gift and letting other people know &#8220;Christ in us the hope of glory&#8221;. We become witnesses of the saving grace. If someone pointed you to Christ, should you not be compelled to do the same?<\/p>\n<p>Of course serving Christ does have benefits too, Psalm 103:1-4, &#8220;&#8230;, Bless the Lord, O my soul and forget not His benefits, Who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who redeem your life from destruction, who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfies your mouth with goods things etc&#8221;. So should I give up on Christ if some of these benefits are not provided? no, because my coming to Him was to receive the gift of eternal life. We need to put the emphasis on the hope to come and not on the benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Serving Christ is not about happiness but righteousness. \u00a0Romans 14:17, &#8220;For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost&#8221;. Meat and drink is about happiness, for believers it&#8217;s more than that, it&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, purity, peace that surpasses all understanding, unspeakable joy full of Holy Ghost. Happiness depends on circumstance, joy depends on the promise that regardless of what happens, I have the joy of knowing that one day when this life is over I will be with Him in heaven.<\/p>\n<p>1Peter 3:15, &#8220;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense (reason) to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear&#8221;. Sanctify is to set apart for sacred use, it&#8217;s also to make holy and purify. The definition I love, sanctify is to make productive of holiness. The Lord is holy, because He lives in us, we have to set ourselves apart in readiness for His use, we have to desire holiness and purity. Our uniqueness will raise questions and what a joy to stand and respond confidently the reason why we serve Christ, to contend for the faith. Are you ready to give an answer if someone was to ask you about your hope in Christ? If asked, would you answer with meekness (submissive, patient, humbleness) and fear (extreme reverence)?. I want to be different in the sight of men and when they ask me what makes me different, I will not be afraid and intimidated to speak of the hope that lies within me.

Many changes have taken place in the course of the years and instead of things getting better and better, they are getting worse and worse but the standard remains the same. For example, when the bible says, &#8220;thou shalt not lust&#8221; it means it, you can try to manipulate and extract words out of it to mean something else but it&#8217;s a simple as it states it, &#8220;thou shalt not lust&#8221; and that is one of God&#8217;s standard for purity. If you look in the bible times, the dressing then and the exposure would not stir much lust compared to sexually charged world today but God has not lowered His standards because of the world in which we are living in. \u00a0Music, movie industry and many more have created standards for the world. Situations have changed, standards have not and never will. We need more grace to live this life.<\/p>\n<p>With situations changing and standards remaining the same, man has gone ahead to establish his own righteousness being ignorant of the righteousness of God, Romans 10:3. Question is, who raises the mark for man to live up to? Today is, &#8220;Whatever fills right in your soul, you are welcome to do it&#8221;. What you respond to might not be what I respond to but if it makes you happy, hey go for it. I live by what I think is right. What might be right for me might be wrong for someone else but you don&#8217;t have to live the way I live. Who is right and who is wrong? The bible says, &#8220;Every way of a man is right in his own eyes&#8221;, any decision that you make, if it&#8217;s not in line with God&#8217;s word but sounds right for you, it&#8217;s your OWN standard. You can take that road even mislead many as you become their measuring stick. Why are so many going a stray? because either they chose to go that road or someone led them blindly. Know the truth and stand for it.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who stands for nothing, will fall for anything. You have to know what you are standing for and be ready to defend it, \u00a0why? because the bible says so, 1Peter 3:15, &#8220;&#8230;always be ready to give a defense (answer) to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope \u00a0that is in you,..&#8221;. When you have a standard mark, are you in a position to defend it? Believers should be in a position to defend their stand that is contrary to worldly standards because they have the bible as their measuring stick. Morals have changed according to the worldly standards, God&#8217;s moral standards remains the same praise God and I have to defend the reason for choosing it. You will always create your own standards or follow other people&#8217;s standards when you do not know God&#8217;s word. It&#8217;s not about what we think the bible should say (liberalism), it&#8217;s about what the bible says that goes. God&#8217;s standards can not be achieved by one&#8217;s strength as we all fail in that. It is by yielding to God&#8217;s grace that we can stand through it all. It&#8217;s not by our own ability we can achieve them, it&#8217;s by our availability to yield to Him. When I look at God&#8217;s standards, I just can&#8217;t see how we can maintain them without Him. With that stand, many will ask the reason we do things differently, and we will give them an answer. We will not fall for anything because we know God&#8217;s word. Do you create your own standards or does the world do it for you or are you upholding God&#8217;s? Stand for what you believe, God will give you grace to maintain it, &#8220;Christ in you, the hope of glory&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Proverbs 21:2, &#8220;Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, But the LORD weighs the hearts&#8221; We live in the most difficult times in history.

How can one stand without it? I have looked at many buildings and I have never seen anyone start by building the walls first \u00a0then worry about laying foundation later. There is something about the foundation that causes us to understand what kind of building the master builder before he begins to build.<\/p>\n<p>When one begins to build, he does not start with hammers and nails but with a plan as the plan will give the master builder an idea of what kind of building he is going to put up, what materials he will need and what foundation to lay. I see this also with Christians, before Christ saved us, He had a plan for our lives and He knew what kind of foundation He would lay down and so He did, He laid down His life as the foundation. Jesus is the firm foundation, 1Cor 3:9-15, &#8220;&#8230;For no other foundation can anyone lay other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8230;&#8221; if He is not your foundation, you have no foundation be sure of that. And if He is not your foundation, you have no hope. \u00a0On Christ the solid rock (firm foundation) I stand, all other grounds are sinking grounds.<\/p>\n<p>Once foundation is secured, building on the foundation begins. The foundation does not give you the look of the building but the preparation and as God begins to build you up, you begin to look like what He had in mind when He laid your foundation. When I became born again, it was not the end but the beginning of building. I know He has the blue print of my life but he can only accomplish it on the foundation He has laid. You might not be sure about what He is doing in your life but thank Him for the foundation He has laid already, the building may take a while to come up but sure enough, he will complete it, see His blue print for your life. Phil 1:6, &#8220;Being confident of this very thing that He who has begun a good work in you will be faithful to complete it&#8221;, He is the only God who never leaves His work un accomplished..<\/p>\n<p>Vs. 12, &#8220;Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay straw, each mans work will be clear; for the day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire&#8221;. I believe that any wall that we put up at one time will be tried by fire. Regardless of how the building is tested by fire, if it stands or falls, the foundation will always remain solid and steadfast. \u00a0This is why we need to be careful about what materials we use to build our lives on this foundation. To name a few, Character is key in building a wall that will stand the test of fire, the word of God, assisting other people, keeping ourselves from sin etc. \u00a0Someone said &#8220;Charisma can put anyone on top, Character will keep him on top&#8221;. At times it may look like nothing much is taking place in your life as your building is coming up slowly but remember when the house is complete, many will admire it as you will say it was worth the process. Keep building your character in Christ, keep reading and memorizing the word, do everything you know will give your house a good image.<\/p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m I saying this morning, build you life on the firm foundation, the foundation already laid. Jesus must be Lord of your life and not just the Savior. He has said that without Him we can do nothing. We will never make it without Him, if we build our walls with wrong materials, when the fire wipes it away, He will still be faithful to stand. Question, is your foundation laid correctly? if so, continue to build. 1Cor 3:16, &#8220;Know ye not that you are the temple(house) of the living God and the Spirit of God dwells inside of you&#8221;.

In this short answer, Jesus brings all the confidence of Nicodemus crashing to the ground, for He states to him that essentially all of his knowledge, all of his pomp, all of his chiefly attainments, and scholarly achievements mean nothing, in the end he will be lost forever if he is not born again. All this day who desire to come into the everlasting kingdom of God must experience this new birth in Christ.<\/p>\n<p>To be born again is to be born from above, to be born of the Spirit by faith, to pass from the death of sin into the promise of eternal life to all who believe, and go on believing by faith and obedience in Christ. To simply reform our lives, to quit bad habits, is not what He speaks of, there must be a conversion. Without this definite work in our lives we will not see the kingdom of God as Jesus says here. We cannot be born into this life because of our families, it is not something just assumed, religious schooling and accrued knowledge cannot do it either, nor can good works, but there must be a moment of conversion, a conscious moment when we made a decision to make Christ Lord of our lives, a moment when we can without any doubt say &#8220;I was born again&#8221;. In Romans 8:16 Paul takes it farther, for all who are truly born again, bear within their heart the Spirit of God, who bears witness within each one that they are truly born again. If we have not this witness, let us this day go back to the cross, seeking our Lord, crying out for forgiveness until we are truly justified by faith in Christ and the merits of His shed blood.<\/p>\n<p>The evidence of this life will be seen by those around you as well, for the life truly born again is a changed life, they are a new creation in Christ Paul tells us in II Cor. 5:17, old things have passed away and all things have become new. They are NOT the same person, nor do they desire or do the same things. A Christian that is truly saved, DOES NOT WILLFULLY SIN, they may stumble, but this becomes less and less as the ongoing work of grace in their hearts brings them deeper in Him, until in a moment the heart is made pure, restoring His divine nature within, that they may live holy lives, living by faith and obedience, for it is certainly possible, and much scripture supports this, to lose your salvation, to fall away from Christ when we willingly ignore His commands and disobey Him.<\/p>\n<p>Theologian Adam Clarke says this,&#8221; Sin must be pardoned, and the impurity of the heart washed away, before any soul can possibly enter into the kingdom of God. As this new birth implies the renewing of the whole soul in righteousness and true holiness, it is not a matter that may be dispensed with: heaven is a place of holiness, and nothing but what is like itself can ever enter into it.&#8221; Dear friends, let each examine their hearts to be sure they are truly born from above, that you have indeed passed from death into life. Are we then resembling Jesus more and more everyday, or are we merely seeking blessings without obedience. Christ affords us many blessings in His word, but they are of a spiritual nature, reserved for His children, those truly pardoned of their sin and living in obedience to His word. Be sure, be sure, never assume, but be sure, this is the basis of the Christian life, it all begins here, don&#8217;t be fooled, we all must be born again, we must truly repent of our sin and turn by faith to Jesus. I assumed for a long time friends, and I praise God everyday that He opened my eyes, for I would have been lost had He not called to me by His grace, waking me from the slumber of secret sin that I might call on Him and be truly saved and sanctified by the God of peace, who now keeps me in the power of His Holy Spirit.<\/p>\n<p>Humbly submitted, to God be the Glory,<\/p>\n<p>Brother Ben<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning John 3:3- &#8220;Jesus answered and said to him, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#8221; My heart was inspired by a recent conversation with a friend, thought I would share on the basics, I think many are missing this step.

However in families when there is competition and comparison, a dividing line is established. The older compared his loyalty to his brothers&#8217; disloyalty toward the father. \u00a0He was accurate in what he said, but he was not right in the attitude of which he said it. \u00a0When we say look at how great I am, and what a loser this other person is, we&#8217;ve established the winner and the loser in life which is NOT a game. \u00a0Imagine if Mary would have said to her other children, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you be perfect like your brother Jesus?&#8221; \u00a0With Satan trying so hard to destroy the family, why should we play according to his tune? \u00a0Satan almost destroyed the younger son in the parable, but the older brother didn&#8217;t care about him, only himself. \u00a0If he wanted accolades then he should \u00a0have allowed his father to say them. \u00a0Proverbs 27:2 says, &#8220;Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2. \u00a0Attitude is everything! \u00a0I&#8217;ve been slaving for you &#8230; never gave me &#8230; this son of yours.&#8221; \u00a0 I&#8217;ve heard it said that life is ten percent of what happens to you and ninety percent of how you respond to it. \u00a0The older brother should have had his younger brother&#8217;s back. \u00a0The younger brother could haven been sick in a hospital, or even dead, but he was alive and had returned. \u00a0The older brother didn&#8217;t contemplate any of those things, only that &#8220;this son of his father&#8217;s,&#8221; as he put it, lost it all the father celebrated his homecoming. \u00a0The older brother would one day receive two-thirds of his father&#8217;s estate as his own inheritance, but he wanted some recognition now! \u00a0He was a hard worker, with a loving father, all his needs were provided for, and his brother was not dead, but alive and back to talk about his &#8220;frivolous adventure.&#8221; \u00a0Paul wrote about how our attitudes should be when he penned the words in Phil 2:5, &#8220;Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: Phil 2:6 Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, Phil 2:7 but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.&#8221; \u00a0The older brother hardly had such an attitude. \u00a0Our attitudes determines a lot. \u00a0Jesus was God, yet became a servant. \u00a0We are not God, yet we don&#8217;t have the attitude Christ displayed.<\/p>\n<p>Have you been playing the comparison games? \u00a0Does your attitude need maintenance today, if so humble bring it in to God&#8217;s presence and have it worked on. \u00a0Don&#8217;t choke on the blessing God has given you.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, I&#8217;m back from vacation I mentioned earlier.

\u00a0We want certain things before the time in which God gives it to us. \u00a0How many have premarital sex prior to God giving one their spouse to walk down the aisle together in God&#8217;s sight? \u00a0When we want it now, chances are that our motive are selfish in nature and the first cough or gag is beginning to manifest. \u00a0In what ways do you seek immediate self gratification?<\/p>\n<p>2. \u00a0Desiring riches over relationship &#8220;the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country:&#8221; The younger son also, desired his riches now over his relationship with his father. \u00a0Again, traditionally he would receive his inheritance after his father&#8217;s death. \u00a0When the father gave him his inheritance early, the younger son left his father, almost treating his father as if he were now dead. \u00a0Wasn&#8217;t his relationship with his father valuable? \u00a0He displayed a disregard for his father&#8217;s authority in his life. \u00a0Sometimes we are so busy chasing after other things that we &#8220;forget&#8221; to chase after God. \u00a0In what ways do we sometimes show disregard for God&#8217;s authority, like the younger son in the story? \u00a0God created us to live in relationship, not as islands unto ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>3. \u00a0The freedom factor &#8220;and there [he] squandered his wealth in wild living:&#8221; The younger son was now free of his father&#8217;s authority. \u00a0He had freedom to do what he wanted, when he wanted. \u00a0He would go where he wanted, be with whom he wanted, say what he wanted, etc&#8230; \u00a0What happens when God gives people freedom to make their own choices? \u00a0He used the freedom he had to get himself into a jam. \u00a0Many feel that if they had more money, they would be better off. \u00a0However it wasn&#8217;t until the son lost it all that he humbled himself, and ran home, back to the father. \u00a0He said to himself, &#8220;I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.&#8221; \u00a0 \u00a0 Why do hard times often bring people to repentance? \u00a0The famous story is told about the little train that wanted freedom from the tracts he was confined to. \u00a0Therefore he jumped off the tracts to his freedom, and was no longer &#8220;limited&#8221; on the confining tracks. \u00a0However now he could now longer travel anywhere, because his designer built him to have mobility only on the tracks. \u00a0Did he really get the freedom he was after? \u00a0The younger son too, ended up not in freedom, but in bondage, until he came to a place of repentance.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s not choke on our blessing because of our desire of immediate self gratification, desiring riches over relationship, the greatly misunderstood freedom factor. \u00a0Thank God for your blessings but don&#8217;t rush things, appreciate your relationships, and don&#8217;t buy into the false freedom Satan offers.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p>FYI &#8211; I&#8217;m going away on vacation, I will try my best to send devo&#8217;s while I&#8217;m away.

5 We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost-also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic. 6 But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!&#8221; \u00a0They never see anything is right! \u00a0They didn&#8217;t see God&#8217;s provision, God&#8217;s protection, God&#8217;s guidance, and God&#8217;s grace, although God did set a table for them in the desert. \u00a0How will you keep from choking on the blessing?<\/p>\n<p>1. \u00a0Don&#8217;t loose your appetite. \u00a0They Israelites physically lost their appetite, because they were not focused on the Lord&#8217;s provision. \u00a0Some however loose their appetite spiritually as well. \u00a0Some stop seeking God and the good things He is giving them. \u00a0The Psalmist wrote, &#8220;Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in him. Psalm 34:8. Israel didn&#8217;t take refuge in God&#8217;s blessing after all \u00a0Where are to &#8220;TASTE&#8221; and &#8220;SEE&#8221; that the Lord IS GOOD, not that He might be good, or that He is good for some and not for others, but for all. \u00a0How is your spiritual appetite been lately?<\/p>\n<p>2. \u00a0Appreciate and partake in God&#8217;s blessing. \u00a0There was plenty of manna to go around for everyone. \u00a0The rabble (non-Israelites) that came out of Egypt benefited by Israel&#8217;s relationship with God too. \u00a0Instead of being grateful, Israel complained about what they didn&#8217;t have rather then appreciate what they did have. \u00a0They had miraculous manna, but craved meat. \u00a0Do you appreciate what God has given you, or do you want something else? \u00a0Many want the bigger, better, latest, and top of the line, because &#8220;Death and Destruction are never satisfied, and neither are the eyes of man.&#8221; \u00a0If God has given you your home, job, spouse, children, finances, abilities, spiritual gifts, personality, material goods, one must first be thankful, because He can take it all away if He desired. \u00a0Job had it all, and then for a time everything was taken away.<\/p>\n<p>3. \u00a0Fear the Lord. \u00a0God sent the meat, quail, because he was fed up with the complaining of the Israelites. \u00a0Ps 34:9 reads &#8220;Fear the LORD, you His saints, for those who fear Him lack nothing.&#8221; \u00a0 The Israelites thought they were lacking, but really their needs, not their &#8220;greed&#8221; were provided for. \u00a0God is a Father that provides. \u00a0Again God can take everything away should He so desire as He did to Job. \u00a0What Israel craved is meat they anticipated to bring satisfaction to their coveting hearts, but it actually brought death. \u00a0&#8220;While the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.&#8221;

Part 1, By Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 13: 1 &#8211; 4 &#8220;So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him. Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold. \u00a0 From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the LORD.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Are you content with what God has given you? \u00a0Solomon wrote, &#8220;Death and Destruction are never satisfied, and neither are the eyes of man&#8221; (Prov. 27:20). \u00a0There is something about the majority of us that always wants more than God has given us. \u00a0 Let me ask you another question. \u00a0When do you seek God most? \u00a0Is it when things are going smooth or when things are not going so well? \u00a0Many seek God when they are not content with the way things are going in their lives. Are we not to seek God at all times, even during times of contentment?<\/p>\n<p>The great prophet Abram (Abraham) is called by God to take all of his things, and his family and to journey to a place that God would show him. \u00a0Abraham obeys God, leaves all that is familiar to him, and starts on his journey to &#8220;God knows where.&#8221; \u00a0When he arrives at a place between Bethel and Ai he builds an altar and calls upon the name of the Lord. Although Abram was rich in cattle, gold and silver, he didn&#8217;t choke on the blessing God gave him. Why not?<\/p>\n<p>1. \u00a0Abram was content. \u00a0Abram didn&#8217;t try to fight God&#8217;s call, but rather took up his household and lived a nomadic lifestyle in his obedience to God. \u00a0He didn&#8217;t go on a journey for more of what he &#8220;wanted,&#8221; but rather more of what God wanted for him. \u00a0Paul wrote that &#8220;godliness with contentment is great gain&#8221; (1 Tim 6:6). \u00a0Are you one that is content, or always wanting for more of what God is not calling you to? Are you content with what God has given you, in your job, your home, your friends, your family, your appearance, or do you yearn for more.<\/p>\n<p>2. \u00a0Abram built an altar. \u00a0 \u00a0What comes to mind when you hear the word altar. \u00a0Perhaps words like sacrifice, sacred, special, offering, incense, prayer, are some of those words. \u00a0An altar was a place designed for worship. \u00a0Pagans set up their altars to worship their false gods many times made of wood, stone. \u00a0God designed humanity to be worshipers, the only question remains is who or what will one seek to worship. Whatever the case, man will build an altar of worship either with his hands or his mind. \u00a0Where is your altar, where is the place that you seek God? No one built the altar for Abram, he built it and so should you establish a place whereby you seek God daily. \u00a0The New Testament refers to the prayer closet as the place to seek Him. \u00a0When two people are going to meet they establish a meeting place. \u00a0Where is your established meeting place with God? \u00a0If you don&#8217;t have a place, establish one today, as a sacred meeting place between you and God.<\/p>\n<p>3. \u00a0Abram called upon God. \u00a0Abram didn&#8217;t allow his wealth to hinder his worship. \u00a0It&#8217;s not enough to build an altar; one must meet with God there. \u00a0Do you meet with God daily at the altar, in the prayer closet? Prayer is a conversation between two people that love each other -you and God. \u00a0Do you daily meet with God in prayer and read His word, because He is the Word (John 1)? \u00a0Some never bother to &#8220;pick up the phone&#8221; to even call God, or if they do, it is a one-sided conversation. What has God been saying to you lately? \u00a0If you&#8217;re drawing a blank, then perhaps you have not been calling upon His name and listening to His response as Abram did. \u00a0If so are you content with that? \u00a0If God has blessed you, don&#8217;t choke on the blessing. \u00a0Be content, build an altar, and call upon God there.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 13: 1 &#8211; 4 &#8220;So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.

And this is the victory that has overcome the world-our faith&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Believers born of God are candidates for victory for they are wired for it. If you were to look at the building you are working in, or living in, you will discover that it&#8217;s wired, has electrical cords, telephone cords among other wiring. This already gives an indication that it&#8217;s wired to bring power, light into the building. Now if the lights don&#8217;t come on because the power is not there, they don&#8217;t rewire the building again, they look for ways to understand why the power is not flowing and correct it. Maybe it&#8217;s not turned on.<\/p>\n<p>This is no different from the believer born of God, wired to overcome the world. The question is, is the power of God turned on in your life that brings about victory or are you looking for ways to rewire your life. What is the world in this case, the world is anything that goes against the knowledge of God. Anything that pulls you in the direction the Lord has not designed for you. Things that make you grievous while others may not feel anything wrong with it, I call that the world.<\/p>\n<p>1 Corinthians 10:13, &#8220;No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it. What is temptation? I love how Paris Readhead defines temptation, he says, &#8221; temptation is the proposition made to the mind to satisfy a good appetite in a bad (forbidden) way and sin is the decision of the will to satisfy a good appetite in a bad way&#8221;. Temptation by itself is not sin, but we are afraid that by it we might sin and we need victory over it. The world presents us with temptation and this verse tells us how common temptation is &#8220;No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man&#8221;. And the verse does not leave us hanging, it also tells us that we are wired to overcome it &#8220;but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able&#8221;. It then tells us that there is a way to escape and gain victory &#8220;with the temptation will also make the way of escape&#8221;. But this verse doesn&#8217;t&#8217; tell us how.<\/p>\n<p>How do we gain victory then if we are born of God? 1John 5:4, &#8220;For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world-our faith&#8221;, again we see that we are wired for victory, &#8220;And this is the victory that has overcome the world-our faith&#8221;, Jesus is the victory that has overcome the world and our faith in Him alone is the power to over come the world. We become more victorious when we eat Him, and drink Him until His nature becomes our nature, and His thoughts becomes our thoughts, His bones becomes our bones. Our faith in Him is the power we need to turn on, but where is the switch? Romans 13:14, But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts&#8221;, Acts 17:28, &#8220;for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, &#8216;For we are also His offspring.&#8217; Colossians 3: 3&#8243;For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 4 When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.<\/p>\n<p>The power you turn on the most is the one who wins. Ephesians 5:14, &#8220;Therefore He says: &#8221; Awake, you who sleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ will give you light.&#8221; Isaiah 60:1 &#8220;Arise, shine; For your light has come! And the glory of the LORD is risen upon you. 2 For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, And deep darkness the people; But the LORD will arise over you, And His glory will be seen upon you&#8221;. Where are you today? Do you realize you&#8217;ve been wired for victory?

Most of it is about temporal needs, that attracts great crowds. Rarely would you hear them talk about heavenly living (holiness, righteousness, long suffering, humility, submission, picking up the cross and following Christ etc) things, which makes us more Christ like.<\/p>\n<p>I tend to visualize how Paul&#8217;s life style would be today if he was still living and what he would teach, and I find it radically different because Paul was more concerned about God&#8217;s glory than pleasing men. He therefore preached the whole truth and how to live it. We read in Colossians the truth every believer should pursue. He begins by saying, &#8220;If then you were raised with Christ&#8230;&#8221; this is a clear indication that no one can become a Christian unless he or she was once dead and Christ made him a live in repentance and faith. Therefore, a believer has a new life with a new nature and new desires. The drives he had before being made a live in Christ are dead with the old man. He is dead to the world but alive in Christ, for in vs. 3, &#8220;For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God&#8221; and such a person has but one desire, &#8220;Lord live your life through me and be thou glorified&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And because we have a new nature, Paul gives us two things I want to look at &#8220;SEEK&#8221; and &#8220;SET&#8221;. He admonishes us to &#8220;Seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right of God&#8221;. The things below are corrupt, perishable; they are temporal, while things above are eternal. &#8220;SEEK&#8221; is to try to find or discover by searching or questioning. Christ sits at the right hand of God the Father making intercession for us. We should &#8220;seek His kingdom first and His righteousness&#8230;&#8221;Matthew 6:33. The seeking is all about advancing the kingdom of God. Seeking spiritual values (the fruit of the spirit). Paul declared that all the richness of truth necessary for salvation, sanctification, and glorification are found only in Jesus Christ, who Himself is God revealed. Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world, so are we. And because we are citizens of heaven, another country, we seek to know the truth of where He belongs. The position of honor and majesty that Christ enjoys as the exalted Son of God, that exaltation makes Him the fountain of blessings for His people.<\/p>\n<p>Those who are seeking things above will discover these flows from that relationship, the desire to please the one who sits on the throne. Vs 12, &#8220;Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; 13 bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do. 14 But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection. 15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. 16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. 17 And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>You and I can only live these because we are constantly drawing from the kingdom what we have no ability to produce in our own strength. What you seek and find, you are encouraged to, vs. 2, &#8221; Set your mind on things above &#8230;,&#8221; it&#8217;s like if you are driving on a highway you SEEK for a certain speed required by the law and then you SET your cruise control. Sometimes the car may increase the speed downhill or loose speed uphill. Your job as the driver is to keep seeking and setting the speed. That is like us, we seek to know the will of God, we set to live according to His will.

Vesuvius, they uncovered the bodies of many of the dead. Among them, they found the well preserved bodies of people who were caught totally off guard by the explosion of this powerful volcano. People were found sitting at their dinner tables, their food still on their plates. Others were found in their beds sleeping. One woman, however, stands out from among all the victims of Pompeii. When the scientists uncovered her body, they found clutched in her hands 10&#8217;s of thousands of dollars worth of precious stones. It seems that as death rained down from the mountain above, she risked her life trying to save a couple of handfuls of her wealth.<\/p>\n<p>Now, 2,000 years later, those things she tried so vainly to hold onto, are the property of another!

His life was saved by the courageous French people who sheltered him and helped him escape. After the war was over, the pilot took all the money he could scrape together and went back to Normandy to look for the people who had helped him. Of the twenty people who had risked their lives for him, he found nineteen. One had been killed in the final fighting.

Gehazi hastened, without being called, to appear before his master. His master asked him where he had been, &#8220;Nowhere, sir&#8221; (said he), &#8220;out of the house.&#8221; Note, One lie commonly begets another: the way of that sin is down-hill.<\/p>\n<p>ILLUSTRATION: A ten-year-old boy was walking with his parents on Elm Street in downtown Dallas. Spying a movie theater, the youngster ran off. His frantic mother found him inside the theater thirty minutes later. Outside, she said to him, &#8220;Whatever possessed you go to in that place? You know that our pastor teaches that it&#8217;s wrong to go to movies.&#8221; &#8220;Mama,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t help myself. I smelled that popcorn, and it smelled so good that I had to buy some. And then the floor of that movie house was so slick I just slid inside.&#8221; Gehazi hadn&#8217;t been spiritually alert, for that reason it caused him to do evil.<\/p>\n<p>VI-NOTICE THE DECLARATION OF ELISHA: 26, &#8220;And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Had Gehazi yet to learn that prophets had spiritual eyes? or could he think to hide anything from a seer, from him with whom the secret of the Lord was? It was foolish for Gehazi to attempt what he did. Sin blinds people to the real circumstances and consequences with which they have to deal. Above all, it destroys our power of sensing the presence of God.<\/p>\n<p>What Gehazi assumed about Elisha, that is, that he would not find out, all sinners assume about Almighty God, that He will not discover anything. But God does find out, and lying always leads to disgrace.<\/p>\n<p>ILLUSTRATION: It is related that a boy was going down to the river for a little swim. As he was leaving the house his father said, &#8220;Be careful, Herbert; the river looks fair and sparkling, but there is an ugly eddy beneath that may prove too much for you. I have tried it and know it is dangerous. It nearly overcame me. Be careful, Son; there is danger.&#8221; Herbert went on and was careful for a time, but the river looked so smooth and peaceful he soon ventured out farther. His companions, who were in bathing with him, admonished him to be careful. But he called back and said, &#8220;I can swim; there is no danger.&#8221; So he ventured out still farther. But soon he was heard calling for help. The undertow had him. He frantically cried for assistance, but all in vain. He went down. So it is with sin.

The grass was equally lush and green in both pastures. Yet each donkey could be seen poking its head through the fence as far as possible to graze on the grass in the adjoining field. As the old saying goes, &#8220;The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We Christians often display that same tendency.

His road home lay across a stream into which his donkey, making a false step, fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter, as the water melted the sack. The Peddler retraced his steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before. When he came again to the stream, the donkey fell down on purpose in the same spot, and, regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired. The Peddler saw through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast, where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt. The donkey, again playing the fool, fell down on purpose when he reached the stream, but the sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. And thus his trick recoiled on him, for he now carried on his back a double burden.<\/p>\n<p>We may successfully deceive others, but we cannot deceive God Gal 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, More lessons to learn from the life of Gehazi, Elisha&#8217;s servant.

The ladies died because they didn&#8217;t use what they had to meet their daily need for food. In reality the bottom line was greed killed them.<\/p>\n<p>Many incidence in the Bible where men wanted that which wasn&#8217;t theirs. In the Garden of Eden, Eve coveted the forbidden fruit and brought sin and death into the world. At Ai, Achen coveted some gold, silver and expensive garments and brought defeat to a nation and death to himself and his family. Ahab coveted Naboth&#8217;s vineyard and committed murder in his attempt to grab what belonged to another. David coveted Bathsheba, Uriah&#8217;s wife, and as a result brought the sword of God into his household for generations. Judas was motivated by a covetous heart. Ananias and Sapphire lied to the Holy Ghost because they were covetous.<\/p>\n<p>In this chapter, we see the little maiden was used of God in the healing of Naaman, C. Gehazi is trying to use God. James Hastings wrote, &#8220;We might call him the Ananias of the Old Testament. Rev.

B. Elisha, a holy prophet, a man of God, has but one servant, and he proves a base, lying fellow.

She had failed to leave a will, or no will was found to her $17,000,000 estate; a mystery still unsolved. She had expertly handled her financial affairs since her husband&#8217;s death in 1895 and therefore many felt that she must have realized that without an will, her fortune would become involved in legal battles. Although, Mrs. Garret, at the time of her death, had only one known relative, a second cousin, and less than a dozen friends; attempts to prove relationship to her and claim a part of her estate was made by more than 26,000 persons from 47 states and 29 foreign countries, represented by more &#8230;than 3,000 lawyers. In their efforts to obtain her estate, there were those that committed perjury, faked family records, changed their own names, altered data in Family Bibles and concocted absurd tales of illegitimacy. As result, 12 were confined, 10 received jail sentences, 2 committed suicide, and 3 were murdered. I wonder how many would have admitted they were guilty of covetousness? Or greed.<\/p>\n<p>Ben-Hadah, the king of Syria had sent Naaman to Israel with a letter of introduction, $20,000 in Silver, $60,000 in gold and 10 suits of clothing. Naaman made three errors! 1) He expected that the letter from Ben-Hadah would bring him special favor in Israel and open doors. 2) He thought he could do things his way. 3) He estimated the wrong cost and thought he could buy from GOD what he needed and received.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, SCRIPT:2 KINGS 5:20-27 A few years ago in Boston, the bodies of two elderly women were discovered in their small apartment.

Soulfishing Ministries&nbsp;&lt;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He removed the high places and broke the sacred pillars, cut down the wooden image and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it, and called it (2 Kings 18:4).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As humanity was created, they were created to worship God, glorify Him and enjoy Him forever. \u00a0Unfortunately, the devastation of sin entered our world because of sin through a decision and action made by our first parents, Adam and Eve. \u00a0From that point, it would seem that our sin saturated hearts chief desire would be to worship and glorify ourselves and anything that would bring personal pleasure to our lives. \u00a0We so naturally think about ourselves first, glory in ourselves, and reveal in ourselves even though we have the stench of sin as the human race and we are ever so comfortable in it. \u00a0Think about this, &#8220;Does a fish know that its&#8217; wet?&#8221; \u00a0Humanity doesn&#8217;t realize that it is saturated in, apart from a supernatural dynamic conviction from the Holy Spirit of God. \u00a0The man John Newton author of the ever popular song realized that he was a wretch before God, hence the line, &#8220;&#8230;that saved a wretch like me.&#8221; \u00a0He went from mistreating slaves he transported, to becoming a slave for Christ (Rom 1:1, Eph 6:6). \u00a0The things we may worship are the very things that God created. \u00a0The Egyptians worshipped the false sun god Ra, yet failed to worship the God that created the sun. \u00a0This is why the plagues of Egypt were as specific as the plagues were the very gods that they worshipped, and in their thinking, seemingly attacking them at the command of the God of Moses.<\/p>\n<p>Can you imagine worshipping something however that God instructed you to make for your healing? \u00a0This is precisely what took place in the time of King Hezekiah (King of Judah) who did what was right in the Lord&#8217;s sight. \u00a0He removed the high places of pagan worship, and cut down the wooden image of the Canaanite goddess Asherah. \u00a0However what seemed to really be eye opening was the next idol that he destroyed to pieces, which was non-other than the bronze serpent that God commanded Moses to hold up in the wilderness to bring healing to those that were bitten by the epidemic of fiery serpents.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hezekiah broke the Nehushtan into pieces, i.e., the bronze snake made by Moses in the wilderness (Num 21:4-9), because Judah had come to worship it as an idol, perhaps influenced by Canaanite religion, which regarded snakes as fertility symbols (The MacArthur study Bible).&#8221; \u00a0Israel was told to look upon it at that time, and because of their obedience and the goodness of God, God healed their infirmities that resulted previously from their own sin. \u00a0Looking upon it never carried the notion to worship the bronze serpent which Israel did 700 years later. \u00a0The focus of this was on the God that healed and not on the serpent itself. \u00a0Instead of it being used as merely a symbol to recognize the goodness and provision of the Lord, Israel began to look at the serpent itself as a diety, and that was a call for its destruction. \u00a0Destroying this relic was no small matter, as it had lasted, and been preserved for quite some time at this point, but a necessary step in Hezekiah cleansing the land of all idols, even one that although did not being as an idol, and used by Moses, had become an idol, and manipulated by the enemy to drive people away from the true worship of God. \u00a0However this is such the nature of humanity. \u00a0Paul reminds us of this fact that happened centuries later in Rome, &#8220;Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things (Romans 1:22).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>However, the bronze serpent, although destroyed because of the idolatrous worship that accompanied it, would be used as a symbol by Christ to bring glory to God. \u00a0Jesus would refer the bronze serpent as a symbol of Himself. \u00a0John wrote, &#8220;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. \u00a0This Jesus would be lifted up (like the serpent in the wilderness) to bring healing to those bitten by the fiery serpent (Satan), however he would be broken just as he symbolized at the last supper when he said to His disciples, &#8220;And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, &#8220;Take, eat; this is My body.&#8221; \u00a0This Jesus was broken on the cross for our sins. \u00a0We dare not glory in anything except the cross of Christ. \u00a0We need not worship, as many do, the symbol of the cross as many look to the cross (as a symbol) without looking to the Christ of the Cross. \u00a0People because of the evil of heart, and natural desire toward idolatry have used the cross as a relic to protect themselves from evil. \u00a0Should a man speed down the highway, but because he has a cross hanging on his rearview mirror, expect to be spared from a traumatic accident? \u00a0It is Christ that saves, not a symbol of Roman execution. \u00a0Many were executed on the cross during Christ&#8217;s time, but it was only the Christ on the cross, that died and rose that gives hope eternal and full of glory.<\/p>\n<p>All of our Christian symbols CANNOT replace the Christ of Christianity. \u00a0Perhaps that is why we don&#8217;t have a picture of Him, because if we did many would worship the picture on Him, instead of Him. \u00a0If you have been guilty of idolatry, then perhaps there are some things you need to break, remove, and throw away. \u00a0Then repent to God, and put your trust in the Christ of Scripture. \u00a0Read your Bible to learn about the Christ of Scripture, and obey the Christ of the Word of God. \u00a0Then go out and preach in obedience the Christ that was lifted up, and under the conviction of the Holy Spirit He will draw others to Himself.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<br \/>\nPhil Sessa, Evangelist (Soulfishing Ministries)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;He removed the high places and broke the sacred pillars, cut down the wooden image and broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made;

You calculate that if you do this for a period of time, you may have success (delayed gratification). Then you realize that even with wise planning things don&#8217;t turn out as you expected or planned. What gave you a fruitful promise is shattered before your eyes with no hope that anything good could ever come out of the failure. This begins to define where you go from here as life questions your ability to be a good wife or husband, a good father or mother to your children, or a good provider. Because of what you&#8217;ve been through, you are afraid of what your children may turn out to be as they grow older. What you thought you had mastered and had under control feels like has come to the end of the road with no answers but failure. It seems like time is running or has run out, you see un accomplished dreams due to major set backs, all you can now see is impotency in some areas of your life and there is no way you can see things being possible. Did I just describe your situation? Then hang on tight, there is good news and the good news is all things are possible.<\/p>\n<p>Reading Mark 10, there is a story about a rich young ruler who came to Jesus. He felt that everything about his life was in place as he had kept most of the commandments. He had wealth and what he felt could be his ticket to salvation. When Jesus pointed to him that his god was his wealth, he went away sad. Jesus turns to His disciples and says, &#8220;How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God&#8221;. They were astonished at His sayings, and He goes further to say 25, &#8220;It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&#8221; What is this all about? It&#8217;s not by wealth and riches that things become possible, it&#8217;s by God&#8217;s greater hand. How many have all the wealth and have no peace, their children are on the loose running wild. If you trust in what you have, you are calling for disaster because sooner or later you will run into a situation where writing a check will not solve a problem. It cannot even buy your way into heaven; it&#8217;s easy for a Carmel to go through the eye of a needle than for riches to make ways for one into heaven. This is not to discourage people from being rich but if the riches are what makes it possible for you then you have failed. God has no problem with you getting stuff; He has a problem with stuff having you.<\/p>\n<p>The disciples stood there and asked, in verse 26, &#8220;Who then can be saved?&#8221; men can&#8217;t but God. This is why Jesus said with men it is impossible but not with God. \u00a0I see how it begins with God and ends with God. If I am going to be a good husband, good father, good in all I do, then I can&#8217;t rely in my ability, with me it&#8217;s impossible but not with God. Mark 9:23, &#8220;&#8230;, &#8220;If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.&#8221; Oh how God desires that we will believe in Him and nothing else, that we will size Him first before sizing the problem, that we will trust Him with what we cannot trust anyone else with, in turn He will turn the impossible to be possible. In Jesus final hours before crucifixion you hear Him praying, Mark 14:36, &#8220;Abba, Father, all things are possible for You. &#8230;&#8221; Jesus knew that the Father had the ability to change His fate and He chose to leave all in His hands. Can we pray the same, &#8220;Abba, Father, all things are possible with You? in light of what my children are facing, all things are possible with You; with my future, all things are possible with You; with everything that has been hard and difficult to deal with, all things are possible with You. It can only be impossible if God is not in it, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PERSON WHO DOESN&#8217;T HAVE TO DO IT HIM OR HERSELF. As you<\/p>\n<p>read my wife&#8217;s Friday devotion, she had major setbacks and that affected us as a young couple. We had plans that we would get married, have her finish school, start working, build our marriage together, save some money to buy a home and have children by now. We have had major setbacks but in the midst of it we have grown in the Lord in ways we could have never imagined. Our faith in God has increased to believe that all things are possible with Him and His will must prevail.

Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly&#8230;&#8230;.Vs 17 He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I usually like to share the word from my experiences, I find it easy to share with people what I have already gone through just to encourage and give them energy to keep going because sometimes we feel like we are going through a lot but someone else went through worse and they survived, and so if you hear their story it gives you the oomph to push on. So my devotion today kind of ties up with what my husband shared on &#8220;God can&#8221; message. I am sure we have all prayed a similar prayer like the one above in Psalm 102 and there are times it did feel like God never answered. Have you ever prayed for something for years and years and then you prayed with someone about the same thing for God to open those doors for that someone and it happened within hours or a couple of days or weeks or just months? And here you are, been praying for years and years and nothing? Yes I have been there and it is quite painful but when we realize that the will of God is different for each one of us just like we are all different from each other, then we understand what it means for God to answer our prayers at His own perfect timing. Isn&#8217;t it interesting we pray to God about something and tell him God please you know my heart you know my desires, I pray that you will grant me this and that at your own perfect timing and when he takes time to give it to you at His perfect timing we give up, throw in the towel, become bitter, depressed, etc.<\/p>\n<p>There are so many stories I can give here but I am going to choose one that happened recently. I graduated as a nurse in 2007 and this was quite an accomplishment for me, see all through my school years up until college, I was a very average student. My siblings were doing much better than I was in school, my two sisters were B+ students and my two brothers were C+ students and me? I&#8217;ll leave that to your imagination. I struggled with school a lot and for some reason when I came to America it seemed like school suddenly made sense and here I was graduating with my bachelors in nursing 5 yrs later. Well, the battle started when I had to sit for my Boards to get my license I thought well, I did well in nursing school and that was a lot of work so if I accomplished nursing school then Boards should be a breeze right?? Wrong!! It took me 8 trials to get my licensure and every time I went to sit for the exams I had to part with $200. I was an emotional wreck, I hated answering this question every time I met people or went to gatherings and people knew I graduated as a nurse being asked all the time so how is work and me having to tell them I&#8217;m not working and then having to answer to why, it was exhausting. But in between my, I think it was the fifth time, I was so broken I remember calling my mom and crying on the phone and asking if I was never meant to be a nurse, if I should go back to school and do something else, was God punishing me for something that I did? Why did God bring me out here and help me through nursing school only to have this tiny road block that I seem to not know how to maneuver around it? Poor mom, she has been a big part of who I am, and she encouraged me and took me back to some basics that I needed to hear and needed to be reaffirmed. So I picked up myself, my husband cried with me, we prayed and I decided that from that day on whatever happens I will love my God, I will serve Him, I will praise Him, I will trust in Him, I will not run away from Him and I will do all these with gladness and JOY in my heart. It was hard, it was very hard, I had come to a point where going to church was a struggle, I did not feel like praising God why should I when I am hurting and feeling like He forgot about me? I still cry when I remember when I made that decision but I cannot overlook my life without God in it and I knew there has to be a purpose and it will all make sense to me one day. I went and sat for my boards a 6th time and a 7th time and 8th was my breakthrough. I remember standing at the door before I entered the exam room and telling God please Lord, I don&#8217;t know where I will put my face if I don&#8217;t come out of here victorious, I know I promised to try until I get it right and I promised to be on your side no matter what but I need this Goliath in my life to die. Those were my exact words and I said if you don&#8217;t go with me Lord, I am dead and I opened the door and went through the routine I had done over and over again. I finished my exam &amp; I had no idea what to think of it. About 3 or 4 days later I received 2 big packages in the mail and I thought oh my word, they have seen my name so many times they are sending me back to nursing school or rejecting me, my heart was literally pounding off my chest, my hands were shaking so bad, I had a tremendous headache as I was opening that package and when I saw passed, I couldn&#8217;t breath, I almost called 911. And the rest is glory to God.<\/p>\n<p>The Joy of the Lord was my strength, I had anxiety attacks thinking of how my friends were going on with their lives as nurses while mine is stagnant, but the Joy of the Lord kept me going. He hears our prayers brethren, he sees our hurts and when the time is right we receive our answered prayers. It might not be the way you wanted it to be but if it comes from the Lord, it will work for your situation. So whatever it is you are praying for do not and never give up, pray earnestly keep knocking and I always like reminding people and myself to leave space for God&#8217;s will to be done, we have all sorts of plans for the future but ultimately its God&#8217;s plan that prevails whether we like it or not or whether we realize it or not. And I will leave you with this keep hope alive, Rom. 5:5 says, &#8220;And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Judy Olang.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 102:1-2, 17 &#8220;Hear my prayer, O Lord; let my cry for help come to you.

The hymn gives us a reference of what the Lord has done and the text lets us know what He is going to do in the days to come.<\/p>\n<p>Do you always wonder whether God could do something spectacular in your life or around you? I know many who are stuck in this place of&#8221;CAN HE?&#8221; They are scared of praying because they don&#8217;t believe God can. I am in a place where I know HE CAN the only question is WILL HE what HE CAN? This has helped me to readjust how I pray to the Lord. I don&#8217;t pray to God anymore about whether &#8220;HE CAN&#8221;, that is settled, my question is will He do what He can. I used to get frustrated when I went before God because of those times I would go before Him and not get anything after I prayed. I got scared of going to ask Him anything until He allowed me to see it differently, I started going to Him because He can. Whether He was going to do it or not was not an issue anymore. What it boiled down to was can I trust Him with what I know He can do. The moment I come to Him, I know He can and believing Him causes me to know He will. The three Hebrew boys had something going on for them; they believed God could (CAN) deliver them from the fire. That was settled in their part as the main thing but they also believed that He would (WILL) deliver them. If He did not deliver them was not assign that He couldn&#8217;t and did not want to, He must have had something better for them. \u00a0To believe He could (CAN) was enough to make them stand in spite of what was a head of them. I&#8217;m not worried anymore about what He can do, the world is already displaying what He has done and these things are great.<\/p>\n<p>Are you getting frustrated that your prayers are not being answered; do you believe that He can? Are you going to Him because He can or out of formality? Change the way you perceive how God operates, begin to believe that He can and then move to the realm of believing that He will for His glory and you will see &#8220;how He will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though it be told to you&#8221; simply because &#8220;He does exceeding abundantly above all we ask or imagine according to the power that works within us&#8221; Ephesians 3:20.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Habakkuk 1:5, &#8220;&#8230; For I will work a work in your days which ye will not believe, though it be told you&#8221; &#8220;Oh Lord my God, when I&#8217;m in your awesome wonder, consider all the things thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear thy roaring thunder, thy power through out [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1876","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-ug","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1876","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1876"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1876\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1879,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1876\/revisions\/1879"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1876"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1876"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1876"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1874,"date":"2010-07-21T18:55:04","date_gmt":"2010-07-21T13:25:04","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1874"},"modified":"2010-09-04T20:38:11","modified_gmt":"2010-09-04T15:08:11","slug":"whose-report-will-you-believe","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/07\/21\/whose-report-will-you-believe\/","title":{"rendered":"Whose Report Will You&nbsp;Believe?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>The LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders.&#8221; Number 13:1-2<\/p>\n<p>People are always giving different reports on the same issue. \u00a0Many scientists at one time reported that the earth was flat, but a minority of people believed it to be round, as did the Bible state the same (Isa. 40:22) \u00a0At one time the scientific majority said the earth sat on a large animal, while the Bible had stated the earth floats free in space (Job 26:7). \u00a0And my favorite, many say you should never discuss religion or politics at a table, 2% of Christians disobey the majority&#8217;s word.<\/p>\n<p>The Lord brought His plan to Moses to send out spies into the land (v.1) by the commandment of the Lord (V.3) were chosen one man from each tribe in Israel. Verses 4-16 describe the names of the rulers from each tribe. Verse 6 speaks of Caleb who was from the same tribe as Jesus (Judah) and verse 16 is when Moses calls Joshua. \u00a0These names are obviously the main characters in the account. \u00a0Moses lays out the blueprints of the assignment. \u00a0They were to bring back a report of the following: #1. \u00a0The People: \u00a0Strong or weak, few or many #2. \u00a0Land: \u00a0Good or bad, fat or lean, wood or not, fertile soil or poor soil? #3 Towns: \u00a0Unwalled or fortified #4 Tangible Evidence (extra credit): \u00a0Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.&#8221; (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) This was going over and above their assignment.<\/p>\n<p>2 Reports returned, one from the majority, and one from the minority. The Majority report stated the following in their report:<\/p>\n<p>Land: \u00a0Flowing with milk and honey People: \u00a0Strong. \u00a0They focused on the fact of the people of Anak that were allegedly giants (v.33). \u00a0It&#8217;s probably more important to say gigantic as a description. \u00a0Writings have been found from the Egyptians written on papyrus (13 Cent. BC) describing fierce warriors in Canaan 7-9 feet tall. Towns: \u00a0Walled and very great Fruit: \u00a0They brought a single cluster of grapes, carried on a pole by to men, along with some pomegranates and figs.<\/p>\n<p>Verse 32 states &#8220;And they brought an evil report&#8221; to the children of Israel. \u00a0Those were the cold, hard facts! Beautiful land &#8211; ugly giants; what were they to do?<\/p>\n<p>The Minority reported the following in their report: Well, one of the spies named Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, and answered Moses&#8217; question with this statement; &#8220;We should go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it.&#8221; Now that&#8217;s an extremely different report, as different as liberals and republicans, night and day, east and west. The Israelite&#8217;s were faced with an important choice; who&#8217;s report were they going to believe? The minority, positive report, full of faith, adventure, and proactively, said, &#8220;We should go up at once and take possession for we are well able to overcome it&#8221; or the majority, evil, doubtful, already defeated, and may I say Satanic report saying &#8220;We can&#8217;t attack those people; they are stronger than we are&#8221;. Unfortunately, they believed the negative report and didn&#8217;t enter the Promised Land for another forty years. \u00a0Were Joshua and Caleb being presumptuous in their faith? \u00a0Perhaps these two knew that &#8220;giants&#8221; were no problem for a Giant God! \u00a0What is the final verdict? Duet. 1:35-38 shows how out of the twelve spies only Joshua and Caleb entered the Promised Land. \u00a0The ten were called by Moses rebellious, unfaithful, grumblers, causing the people to lose heart. None of the men of that evil generation Moses, said, would enter into the Promise Land, except Joshua and Caleb. \u00a0Funny,! what were the names of the other spies?, I can&#8217;t remember.<\/p>\n<p>Application: \u00a0God has placed a dream, passion, destiny or promise in your heart, you must be willing to kill some giants of doubt, fear and unbelief, to attain it! We must go forward unafraid and not be so easily dissuaded from the aspirations God has placed in our hearts.

Those are the times you begin to trace back to what might have started to bring you to this condition. When you are sick and go to the doctor what do they do? run some tests on you and ask about family health history. He is trying to see where what you have could started from. And if one of your family members had\/have it, the conclusion would be, most probably that is where you may have inherited it from.<\/p>\n<p>We come to Christ and we think the same also happens. The good question to ask, &#8220;When you got saved, what were you saved from if what you used to deal with has to follow you into the new life?&#8221; 2Corinthians 5:17 says, &#8220;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new&#8221;. So \u00a0past failures are not factors into your new life and cannot negate the future. Many are down because they do not believe God loves them in spite off. There is nothing you and I can do to make God love us more or less. The feeling of condemnation about the past failures is stopping some from progressing. Paul comes and tells us in Romans 8:1, &#8220;There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit&#8221;. If you are in Christ, you ought not to feel condemned for that was taken care off when He took all your guilt and shame upon Him on the cross. I must say that this only applies to those who are in Christ. How about those who are not, John 3:18, &#8220;He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. This is not believing that Christ is Lord (head knowledge) but believing and walking in that belief.<\/p>\n<p>If that is settled, then we have our Lord reminding us to do something. Psalms 81:10 is very vital to my new life. &#8220;I am the Lord YOUR God&#8221;, which shows that He knows me and He has called me His. Then He reminds me of where he called me from sin and bondage. Egypt in this case is the type of the world. Him reminding me is not to make me depressed but reminding me of His goodness. Romans 2:4, &#8220;Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?&#8221; His goodness brought me this far and I thank Him for that but He wants to do more. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it, fill it with what? joy, laughter, confidence, peace, prosperity, hope, holiness, purity. He will only fill you if you open your mouth and He will fill you with what you have room for. Don&#8217;t linger on what could have happened, expect what will happen. Your history is not a mystery to God. Choose this morning to open your mouth wide because He will fill you.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 81:10,&#8221;I am the LORD your God, Who brought you out of the land of Egypt; Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it&#8221;.

In times as these, we as Christian begin to question God. We ask questions like,&#8221; How could you let this happen to me if you love me?&#8221;. When we are faced with situations like these, there are scriptures from the bible that help us understand God&#8217;s plan for our lives.<\/p>\n<p>There are 3 stories in the bible that are different, yet they speak the same truth to us. If you look at the story of the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, the story of Abraham, and the story of David, what do you see as common about these stories? They are stories of promise. Stories of what God promised to do. In Exodus, God had promised to deliver the Israelites. In Abraham&#8217;s story, God had had told him to leave his land and go to the place where he would show him. He also promised to give him a son. In David&#8217;s story, God had promised to make him King. The other thing that is common with these stories is that all the promises that God made came at a much later time than what was anticipated by the recipients. Another similarity is that between the promise and the fulfillment of the promise, the recipients endured tough times, temptations, hardship, and at certain times gave up, wanting to look back, or wanting to take a short cut. When the Israelites were in the desert, things were so bad that they said to Moses, &#8220;We were better of in Egypt than here. Forget the promised Land and lead us back to Egypt&#8221;. When David was anointed King, He was constantly pursued by Saul. He was constantly fleeing and most times weary. When Abraham saw that his promise was not being fulfilled, he was getting frustrated. He tried to take a short cut by sleeping with his maid.<\/p>\n<p>Today, God has promised us good things. He has promised to bless us. Jeremiah 29:11 say that &#8220;for I know the plans I have for you&#8230;&#8221; Our Destiny was already ordained by God before we were even born. He says, &#8220;before you were born I knew you..&#8221; This is the trick though. God never explains the process on how He is going to bless you. He doesn&#8217;t explain every step that you will go through, the tough times, the temptations and the hardship. He knows that if He lets you take a glimpse at the process, you will never take a step towards your destiny. If God had told the Israelites that they would wander in the desert for 40 years and struggle the way they did, they would have never left Egypt. If David Knew that he would be a target of Saul, he would have chosen not to be King. If Abraham knew the problems he would face when he left his home, he would have never left. The reason why the bible calls these men &#8220;The warriors of faith&#8221; is because no matter what they went through, no matter what the situation was, no matter how bad things were, they only had one thing going for them FAITH. They believed God. They never looked back at where they had come from. Going back was never an option. They realized that it was not by might, not by power, but by His spirit. Today we can learn from these men. God has given us promises. He has plans for us. A lot of times He shows us the promise, but He doesn&#8217;t tell us the process. He may have promised you a good job, but He will not let you know that maybe at some point you will have to leave your current place, either voluntarily or otherwise and go through some financial struggles. He may have promised you a ministry, but He wont let you know that maybe you will suffer some set backs. He may have promised you a good husband or wife, but He wont let you know that there are times that things will be so bad between you and your partner. big fights, even brake ups. It is up to us to say, &#8220;Lord, you promised, and I will stay faithful until it comes to pass. No matter what I go through, no matter how rough it is, no matter how much I want to give up, help me keep the faith&#8221;. Paul says, &#8220;I have fought a good fight, I have ran the race, I have kept the faith, and now I await the crown&#8221;. No matter what the situation is, we should remember that nothing can separate us from the love of God. Neither death, nor principalities not trials and tribulations. When he has tried us, we shall come forth as gold.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Jimmy<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, It gives me pleasure again to have my younger brother share devotion with us.

Trust in the Lord for ever, for the Lord, the Lord is the Rock eternal. He humbles those who dwell on high, he lays the lofty city low; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust. Feet trample it down-the feet of the oppressed, the footsteps of the poor.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What does the word steadfast mean? It means unchanging, loyal, fixed, or constant etc. Have you ever been in situations or gone through life where you felt like you were between a rock and a hard place? You felt like the ground was sinking beneath your feet? You felt like the walls of this world were closing in on you and you are panicking and feeling like running out of air? Have you ever felt like you are the only one in this world going through difficulties and challenges that you feel like no one else has any idea what its like? Have you ever felt like the devil was sitting right on top of you and you were suffocating and everything you do and touch is messed up, nothing is working right? I will join you in saying YES! Even us as saved Christians go through all the above but what we do after we encounter hardships and challenges of this world is what matters most. I have seen so many professed Christians cuss God and leave their faith because life did not go their way and so they feel entitled to take matters into their own hands instead of looking up to God for help and strength and understanding. And Isaiah tells us very perfectly that when we fix our eyes on God, he will keep us in his perfect peace, that no matter what is going on around us we will be intact because we trust in him.<\/p>\n<p>We need to channel our life line straight with God so that when troubles of this world come our way, we don&#8217;t loose focus, we don&#8217;t doubt. Let them find us steadfast\/loyal\/fixed on God and that is the one life line that the devil cannot and will not break. BUT if we have our life lines here on earth guess what? They will be broken and vanish never to be seen again. The one constant that never changes and is always there no matter what, is the mighty God we serve. \u00a0When my father died 14 yrs ago, I was turning 17 yrs old in a month&#8217;s time, my world came crushing down. I started thinking of how our lives were basically over for me, my siblings and my mother. I did not see how we were going to survive without my dad as our major bread winner and as a father. In my eyes we were finished, very bitter and angry at the Lord for a while \u00a0because before my father died we were facing a lot of hardships. Sometimes we did not even have food to put on the table, we went to bed hungry and sometimes my parents could not afford school fees and we would be home and no one really knew what was happening out there. They would see us and think we had a wonderful life but we didn&#8217;t. Anyhow, so when dad died a horrific sudden death, you bet I was angry with God but I remember my Pastor talking to me and encouraging me and something he said that I have always remembered and will was he asked me where my life line was connected. I realized then that I had my life line connected to my dad and that was not the way to go. So even though dad was never coming back I knew I would see him again and I reconnected my life line to God.<\/p>\n<p>Has life been easier since then? NO, but, I thank God for the many other blessings in my life and the provision he has constantly given us at his perfect timing. When I see how far we as a family have come there is no way we would have made it if it wasn&#8217;t for a higher power which is God. So when life throws a curve ball at me, I know even if I&#8217;m hit, I find my strength in the Lord for Luke 10:19 &#8220;I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I would therefore encourage you with this, be steadfast in the Lord, don&#8217;t be lukewarm or like a chameleon (changes color depending on the surrounding) that when life is good that&#8217;s when you praise God and when life is going down the drain you cuss God and leave him. Let&#8217;s take a stand and I kid you not if you choose the Lord&#8217;s side, you will never be disappointed. So I leave you with this Psalm 37:7 &#8220;Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.&#8221; And remember, unlike parents, God will not give you what you want just because you throw a temper tantrum, no, he does not work that way! Have a temper tantrum free day.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Judy Olang<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Isaiah 26: 3-6 &#8220;You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in you.

So he came and took the body of Jesus. &#8230;. 41 Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 42 So there they laid Jesus, &#8230;&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We have an account of the burial of the blessed body of our Lord Jesus. Jesus had just died, his disciples were scattered no where to be found, the women including Jesus&#8217; mother were standing there helpless. There was no one to claim the body of our dear Savior. He had died like a criminal among criminals; the Father had turned His face away from looking at the wrath He poured on His Son for our sins. And this man who had healed the sick, raised the dead, fed the hungry, taught multitudes had no one or less people attend his funeral, leave alone claim His body but then here comes Joseph of Arimathea.<\/p>\n<p>No mention is made in the entire New-Testament story, but only in the narrative which each of the gospels gives us of Christ&#8217;s burial, wherein he was chiefly concerned. Joseph of Arimathea was apparently a man of wealth, and probably a member of the Sanhedrin (the council that conspired to kill Jesus). According to Mark 15:43, Joseph was an &#8220;honorable counselor, who waited for the kingdom of God&#8221;. He was a disciple of Jesus, only secretly. He was not on the forefront like Peter, John and the rest. He was not known for the fear of the Jews. Maybe he feared that they would stop him from going to the temple, or kill him or he was concerned of what people would think of him.<\/p>\n<p>What prompted this man to come out and identify himself as a disciple of a dead man and claim His body? I believe he died with Christ the day Christ died. His love for Christ propelled him to do something, knowing that Christ loved him first and demonstrated it by dying for him. 2Corinthians 5: 14 &#8220;For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.&#8221; No longer living for himself, no longer afraid of what people would think of him. He came out and identified with the man numbered among the thieves. The bible says that he had a brand new tomb, never used. Who knows whether he built that tomb for the body of our Savior Jesus Christ? While people did not believe that Christ would rise again, Joseph had faith that Christ would rise again and would need his tomb for the weekend.<\/p>\n<p>Something happened that day that awakened Joseph of Arimathea. Seeing His Savior die on the cross naked, battered and bruised, the wrath of God poured on Him yet He said, &#8220;Father forgive them for they know not what they do&#8221;, something spectacular happened that day in the life of Joseph that he would not be silent no more. He had been secret \u00a0to this point, but not any longer. While those who walked close to Christ and known by everyone were nowhere, Joseph, least known Joseph &#8220;&#8230;asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>God raised up this gentleman to interpose in him, that the scripture might be fulfilled. When God has work to do he seeks those like Joseph who are available to be used despite their background because they have seen the cost to appreciate the sacrifice. And for this reason, they can say &#8220;I&#8217;m part of the fellowship of the unashamed. I have the Holy Spirit power. The die has been cast. I have stepped over the line. The decision has been made. I am a disciple of His. I won&#8217;t look back, let up, slow down, back away, or be still &#8230;&#8221;author unknown. Have you been a secret disciple like Joseph,? Picture the cross of Jesus 2thousand years ago and let that compel you to die to everything that has led you to stay secret. The cross is the defining factor, Paul says, 1 Corinthians 2:2, &#8220;For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 19:38 After this, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission.

Here the heart of God is revealed to us. Here one of the great problems of Western Christianity is laid before all of us, may we now examine our own hearts. Time is ticking away, and there is much work to be done, but how many are truly concerned with the things that concern our God? How many are so consumed with enjoying this life that they are unable to turn their attention to the things of God? The word stir means to rouse oneself from spiritual drowsiness.<\/p>\n<p>In Ephesians 5:8-14, Paul deals with the same topic as Isaiah here does. He reminds them that they were ONCE darkness, but are NOW light, and they are to walk as children of light, worthy of the calling of Christ. Are we still darkness, or have we truly come into the glorious day revealed by Christ being truly formed within us? He then goes on to instruct them to have NO fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but to expose them. The church in America fails sadly at this point in many places, for they willingly fellowship with the world, and do what the world does. We must be a separate people, a holy people, a peculiar people. If the world is reveling in fleshly entertainment, drinking, smoking, swearing, and all the other things they do, what place does the church have here? None. We are called to a higher life, a holy life, where the glorious presence of our Lord shines from our lives in such a manner that it reveals all darkness around us. In I Peter 4:18, Peter quotes,&#8221; If the righteous scarcely be saved, Where will the sinner and the ungodly appear?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Further in Ephesians 4, Paul states that all things are made manifest by the light, and the Greek here is translated that all things which are reproved, are thereby dragged out into the light. The holy light of the gospel, the testimony of Christ burning within the heart of the truly born again believer in Jesus, is purposed to expose all darkness. If sin still exists in our lives, if we live in condemnation, we will never bring this light, for we will be afraid to expose our own hearts. In Colossians 1:21-22, Paul declares that we have been reconciled through the death of Christ, to present us holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight. Above reproach means to be above blame or accusation, the true testimony of all who are genuinely washed in the blood of Calvary&#8217;s Lamb and continually walking by faith and obedience. Not the devil, nor this wicked world, has anything to point at in their life, they have nothing in them, and without condemnation they may declare the holiness of our God, and the coming judgment, knowing they are truly redeemed. What a confidence this is to have!<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, Paul encourages in Ephesians 4, &#8220;Awake, you who sleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ will give you light!! Praise God, our Lord waits for each one to awaken themselves from the comfortable slumber of complacent Christianity, He waits to give abundant life, free of sin, to all who will stir themselves up, to all and any who will lay hold of Him by faith, and not let go until He blesses them!! Praise God for His unending mercy, for His faithfulness, and for His precious promises. Now, let us stir ourselves up, for he will not hide His face forever. Surrender all to Jesus, and never look back. Come to the altar, and present yourself as a living sacrifice, and leave your life there, don&#8217;t take it back, it belongs to Him if we are truly His.

After the departure of Christ, we see Peter assume the role of leadership over the disciples. We see him and the rest used mightily of God. The once upon a time coward Peter who denied Christ was bold enough under the unction of the Holy Spirit to preach Christ even to the point of being thrown in prison. Peter was no stranger to prison neither were some of the disciples as we read in the book of Acts.<\/p>\n<p>In Acts 2, Peter preached the gospel and about three thousand people were converted, in Acts 3, Peter and John under the power of the Holy Ghost healed a man. They used the healing as a spring board to preach Christ but this led to their arrest. We need to note that the devil is not happy when the work of God is in progress. He does not want God glorified; he would rather take the glory and not God. And as long as you are determined to bring glory to God where you are, be ready to be under attack. The enemy will always say, &#8220;throw down your weapon and I will leave you alone, stop serving and I will leave you alone&#8221;, he will threaten to take away your freedom, squeeze, frustrate, try to silence and get you overwhelmed. His aim is to stop God&#8217;s work whatever the cost.<\/p>\n<p>While they threatened the disciples to take away their freedom, they prayed for boldness to continue to preach the word of God stopping at nothing. Continuing in power in the early church, the bible says, Acts 5:12&#8243; &#8230; through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomon&#8217;s Porch. &#8230;. 14 And believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, 15 so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might fall on some of them. 16 Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed&#8221;. God&#8217;s work was on the move and this opened more to persecution.<\/p>\n<p>Who tends to be a threat to the enemy? Those who are in the will of God, hungry to see Him glorified. Those who want to serve Him. Those who are not a threat are less under attack but those who have counted the cost and placed their lives on the line for the sake of Christ are opened to attack. And the attack I take a close notice of in the book of acts is freedom taken away from God&#8217;s people so as to silence them from proclaiming what they had seen and heard. But God will not let the enemy prevail, Acts 5: 17 &#8220;Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with indignation, 18 and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. 19 But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, 20 &#8220;Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life.&#8221; They imprisoned them, God sent His angel to free them for His service. You would wonder why the Lord would not prevent them from going to prison. I believe the Lord used those times to confirm to them that they were in His will, to strengthen their faith as He demonstrated His power, and to prove to those who wanted to silence His work His power.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever you feel imprisoned for doing God&#8217;s work, the Lord will always provide a way of escape by opening the prison doors for your release to keep serving Him.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Acts 5: 17 &#8220;Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with indignation, 18 and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison. 19 But at night an angel of the Lord [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-1857","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-tX","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1857","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=1857"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1857\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1858,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/1857\/revisions\/1858"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=1857"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=1857"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=1857"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":1855,"date":"2010-07-08T19:37:03","date_gmt":"2010-07-08T14:07:03","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/?p=1855"},"modified":"2010-09-04T20:16:22","modified_gmt":"2010-09-04T14:46:22","slug":"freed-to-serve-him-part-1","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2010\/07\/08\/freed-to-serve-him-part-1\/","title":{"rendered":"Freed To Serve Him, Part&nbsp;1"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 39:6, &#8220;Thus he left all that he had in Joseph&#8217;s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>To take a way a man&#8217;s freedom is to take away his reason for living. Watching inmates being interviewed especially those locked up in a confined environment talk candidly about what it means and feels to loose freedom. There are some who end up going crazy because their freedom is taken away due to what&#8217;s been done.<\/p>\n<p>Recently I shared off Genesis 39, I feel compelled to look at it again as I gained some new insight off the passage. From Genesis 39-42, about 20 times the word ALL is used in reference to Joseph, which I find very important. The ALL I look at deals with his freedom given to him to act in some capacities. Going back to Genesis 39 where Portiphar made Joseph the overseer of ALL that he had, we see him living freely. Given freedom to control, direct, handle, in charge of all in Portiphar&#8217;s house. What is freedom? There are several definitions depending on the circumstance, for the sake of what I am sharing today, I would define it as the ability to act freely or a state in which somebody is able to act and live as he or she chooses, without being subject to any undue restraints or restrictions. A state of independence. Joseph had that in Portiphar&#8217;s house. \u00a0He was brought to be a slave, the way he lived suggested more than a slave.<\/p>\n<p>Of course we know that freedom was taken away from him and confined in prison where he was no longer in charge of Portiphar&#8217;s house and his movement was restricted having been accused of attempted rape. All that he was in charge of was gone.<\/p>\n<p>Who does not love freedom? Yet in the realm of our day to day lives we crave for freedom but we have an enemy who wants to take that freedom away from us. There are people right now reading this who at one point felt freedom in certain areas of their lives but right now feel caged, imprisoned, bound because an enemy has done this. The joy of being free is gone; you wake up each day feeling imprisoned in fear, doubt, depression, and defeat. Your financial situation has left you imprisoned to debt and you don&#8217;t feel freedom to serve the Lord like you should. Family situations, sickness have imprisoned you.<\/p>\n<p>I have a word for us from the Lord, Psalm 146:7, &#8220;&#8230;The LORD gives freedom to the prisoners&#8221; but for what purpose? To be free to just enjoy ourselves and do what we want? No, Free to serve Him. That ought to be the drive for the desire for freedom. When God said in Exodus that he heard the cry of His people the Israelites, He&#8217;s main reason for coming to their rescue was not to bring them to the promise land to escape their bondage, prisons, it was to make them free that they may serve Him. Exodus 4: 22 Then you (Moses) shall say to Pharaoh, &#8216;Thus says the LORD: &#8220;Israel is My son, My firstborn. 23 So I say to you, let My son go that he may serve Me&#8221;. Joseph had the same freedom to serve God in Portiphar&#8217;s house, even in prison and when he was elevated out of prison to be Portiphar&#8217;s boss. Thank God for benefits too that come about when He frees. John 8:36, &#8220;Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Are you craving for freedom this morning? Is this your cry? &#8220;God free me from my prison to freely serve You&#8221;?, that is my prayer, I am imprisoned in some areas of my life and only Him can free me from my prison and lead me to serve Him more and more freely.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 39:6, &#8220;Thus he left all that he had in Joseph&#8217;s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate&#8221;.

Something in your life was deteriorating or missing in your life? I have many times. There are times I was either gasping for breath or in need of life support. Well we praise God for He is the breath giver. When God formed the spirit of man in Genesis 2 He reached for the ground and picked up clay to form man. In as much as the man looked like what he was created to be, man could not function, see, move, stand, have knowledge, have feelings, emotions, have joy or smile because one important thing was missing, life.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that God will not start something and not finish it, when God formed man, for His work to be complete; He had to breathe on that life less structure that man would become a living being. He created man&#8217;s spirit, He formed his body and He breathed on him. The breath of God is the seal and approval for something to function. Were it not for the breath of God which was neither created nor formed, man will be of no use, dead, nothing. With this understanding, I know that in as much as the body is there and it can be seen, without the breath of God to bring it to life, man cannot live. That breath that cannot be seen but felt is what makes a difference.<\/p>\n<p>This is God&#8217;s breath we need in areas of our lives we feel dead. Breathe on me Lord, breathe in every part of my life that&#8217;s feeling dead, breath on my destiny, and breathe on my dreams and desires. Breath on me to stand and fight, breathe on me that I may be aware of what is accepted and what is not, breathe on me that I may keep on moving, breathe on me that I may always serve and worship You, Please breath on me Lord.<\/p>\n<p>For one to be alive, there has to be breath and over and over again we see people who had died being raised by the breath of God coming back into their bodies. Yes the body was there and we know that the spirit does not die but the breath of God had departed and however precious the body was, it would not be kept around for it will decompose but the moment the breath of God came back to it, that which couldn&#8217;t see begins to see, that which couldn&#8217;t talk begins to talk, that which couldn&#8217;t reason, begins to reason and etc for the breath of God enables us to do the impossible.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how my body functions and how my legs work and how I have the ability to move but one thing I know for sure, the breath of God gives me life. There are certain things I will never fully understand about who I am and where I am going but just understanding that He has breathed on me, gives me the assurance to know that I can make it because of Him. What part of your life feels dead, you feel like nothing good could come out of it, you have tried to nature it but it&#8217;s decomposing more and more? How about some things you have trusted God for? Let&#8217;s ask the Lord to breathe on us His breath again. Acts 17:28, &#8220;For in Him we live and move and have our being.

Solomon himself says in Ecclesiastics 12:13-14 &#8220;Now all has been heard, here is the conclusion of the matter, fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man, for God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing whether it is good or evil.&#8221;&#8230;He enjoyed at his best but at the end he lamented for all his deeds.. We can find peace and true joy only in the presence of the Lord as Asaph did&#8230;&#8221;For it is good for me to draw near to God. I have put my trust in the Lord God, that I may declare all your works&#8221; Psalm 73:28 ..The Bible also encourages us to believe in the Lord..&#8221;Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD.There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off. &#8221; Proverbs 23:17-18&#8230;also it tells us the end of sinners..&#8221;Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of the wicked, for the evil man has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out&#8221; Proverbs 24:19-20&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>Psalms 1 gives us a wonderful distinction between a person who follows the Lord and one who does not follow the Lord&#8230;&#8221;Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers. &#8221; Psalm 1:1-3&#8230;and also it wonderfully tells the end of the wicked people \u00a0&#8220;Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the wind blows away.

Just because some don&#8217;t make it to the end does not mean it&#8217;s not there. If there is a start and end, it&#8217;s not a matter of how you begin the race that defines you, it&#8217;s how you end it that counts. You&#8217;ve heard of cases of people starting great but finished poorly then here comes other people who may have not had a happy and good beginning but in the end built legacies left behind. The question is, should my beginning be great and my end be poor or should I not worry much about how I start but work towards my finish?<\/p>\n<p>John 15 calls us branches, our position is to abide and our destiny is to bear fruit, more fruit and much fruit. We are not expected to produce fruit, that is Christ&#8217;s job, we bear fruit already produced as long as we are attached to the true vine. Mark the way Jesus begins in John 15:1, &#8220;I am the true Vine&#8230;&#8221;, There were many other vines out there people could attach themselves to, He therefore distinguished Himself from the other vines. We need to be identified with our new birth as we understand who we are in Christ and we begin to bear fruit not because someone somewhere gave us identity but because we have found a Master who knows how to define us. With this understanding, we are not limited to what we have, but desiring to have much more. Be it growth, career, marriage, family, and ministry as long as you are attached to the true vine in other words being in His will, He will be faithful to do it. You and I are destined to make a difference wherever the Lord places us. We are the salt of the earth, rich (materially, spiritually, good works, emotionally). Your pew ought to change because you are sitting in it; your surrounding ought to shine because of God in you. Since you are abiding in Him, He will allow you to bear exactly what He had destined for you in life. I don&#8217;t want to reach heaven only to be shown things my heavenly Father stored for me in this life that I never utilized simply because I wasn&#8217;t abiding like I should have. Hanging out with the wrong people and being in wrong places and associating with wrong things will hinder my fruit bearing, in fact that may stunt our fruit bearing, the bible says, &#8220;Choose your friends wisely&#8221; and Psalms 1:1-3 sums it up.<\/p>\n<p>This is true&#8221; &#8230;for without me you can do nothing&#8221;, &#8220;Destiny is not a matter of Choice: It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved&#8221; \u00a0&#8212; William Jenning Bryan. Yes I started poorly as I was on my own, and being on my own caused me to mess up big time but when He redeemed my life, He changed my way of thinking, behaving, acting and dependence and now I am destined to abide in Him. Abiding in Him defines my future after all, He is the best in future making, my end will bring glory to His name and my testimony will touch many lives. Enoch walked with God, all he left was a testimony that he had pleased God. David walked with God, he left behind a testimony that he a man after God&#8217;s own heart. My encouragement to all of us, how poorly we started should not be our biggest concern, how we will finish the race while abiding in Him is what matters and what will count, 2Tim 4:7, I have fought a good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith&#8221; blessings Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 15:5, &#8220;I am the vine, yea are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing&#8221;.

Be blessed as you read part 2 of Pastor Phil&#8217;s devotion<\/p>\n<p>A clear biblical vision will lead us to GO (a word of commission) 9And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.<\/p>\n<p>I have heard it said that most of the church has as much zeal for evangelism as the world has for righteousness. \u00a0The Great Commission is a command, not a suggestion. \u00a0We are all called to go to the lost and warn the people of the coming judgment of God. \u00a0In light of Isaiah&#8217;s vision he knew he was sinfully filthy, and lived among sinfully filthy people. \u00a0When he was cleansed, how could he not want the other filthy persons, to know the cleansing from sin by the Lord? \u00a0Yet many are selfish, and would rather keep this Great News to themselves. \u00a0Imagine if you had the cure for cancer, and failed to share it with others. Would not that be a sin against all humanity? \u00a0How much more should those that have the cure for sin, in the blood of Christ, share the truth of the Gospel with those that have the cancer of sin. \u00a0There is only one remedy for sin, and that is the righteousness of Jesus Christ. &#8220;For the wages of sin is death (the cancer), but the gift of God is everlasting life (the remedy).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A clear biblical vision will lead us to this imperative threefold vision, Isaiah needed to see beyond pride &#8220;King Uzziah died&#8221;, to his own sinfulness &#8220;I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips; and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. \u00a0He realized that he was sinful, and those around him were sinful as well. \u00a0We must realize that our biggest problem and the world&#8217;s biggest problem is not the economy, housing, health care, the stock market, but SIN! \u00a0Our issues with health, money, death, etc&#8230;, all stem from sin. \u00a0Furthermore, our issues of abortion, murder, rape, suicide, homosexuality, fornication, pedophile, etc&#8230; \u00a0Romans states that &#8220;the wages of sin is death (6:23).&#8221; \u00a0Sin is our rebellion of God, shown in our transgression of His Moral Law (the Ten Commandments). \u00a0God must open our eyes to see sin for what it is. \u00a0Sin must become, as Paul said, exceedingly sinful (Roman 7:13).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Leonard Ravenhill shares the following in His book Why Revival Tarries: &#8220;It was a vision of height &#8211; he saw the Lord high and lifted up. \u00a0A vision of depth &#8211; he saw the recesses of his won heart. \u00a0And a vision of breadth &#8211; he saw the world. A vision of holiness, Oh, beloved! \u00a0How this generation of believers needs the vision of God in all His holiness! \u00a0A vision of hellishness &#8211; &#8220;I am undone&#8230;unclean!&#8221; and a vision of hopelessness &#8211; implied by the words &#8220;Who will go for us?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ravenhill furthermore states, &#8220;In this hour &#8211; when the average church knows more about promotion than prayer, has forgotten consecration by fostering competition, and has substituted propaganda for propagation &#8211; this threefold vision is imperative.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>SWAT (SO WHAT APPLICATION TIME) Do you have a threefold vision? \u00a0Would another mature godly Christian attest to this in your life? \u00a0What role does pride play in your life? \u00a0Are you feeding into pride or allowing God to kill it in you, by submitting to Him? \u00a0If you are not a Christian, then are you ready to acknowledge the truth about your sin (measuring your sin against the 10 Commandments), confessing and repenting of your sin, and putting your trust in Christ (the only One that can cleanse you.)<\/p>\n<p>1. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Teaching.

She is such a blessing in my life and I hope you be blessed as she shares. Ev<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 45: 4-5, 7-8 &#8220;Then Joseph said to his brothers, &#8220;Come close to me.&#8221; When they had done so, he said, &#8220;I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.&#8221;&#8230;&#8230; vs. 7-8 &#8220;But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.&#8221; NIV.<\/p>\n<p>I have been reading the Bible from cover to cover and this is my 3rd time starting from Genesis again and it always amazes me how every time I read the passages I already read before there is always a new revelation or a renewed understanding of what I am reading at the time. I am assuming we are all familiar with the story of Joseph, how his father Jacob loved him more than his other brothers and this resulted into jealousy among his brothers and they eventually sold him off to the Egyptians and they came back and lied to their father that Joseph died. I have always wondered if that was me and I survived like Joseph did, what I would want to do to my brothers, people that I thought loved me and were my own flesh and blood. Could you imagine the kind of feelings that would be going inside your heart? But what did Joseph do? I believe the first and the second time he encountered with his brothers he was tempted to revenge or get even but I believe he stopped himself because he was a man of God and he realized that what he was doing was not right.<\/p>\n<p>We all face or have faced or will face circumstances like Josephs&#8217; where your own people that you thought you could count on, sell you out. Family members that you thought had your back actually didn&#8217;t and friends that you thought were closer than a brother were just pests. So when you come into that situation what are we as Christians supposed to do? As humans we want revenge and we want them to suffer as much as we did, but is that the heart that a Christian should have? We are told in the bible that vengeance is of the Lord. So what do we do? We become the bigger people and return good for evil, we forgive even when it&#8217;s clear that the other person ought to be the one asking for forgiveness. We live in harmony and peace as much as possible with our neighbors and we carry ourselves like Christians. We watch our tongues, what comes out of our mouths should not make people&#8217;s heads turn with disbelief and wonder what kind of a Christian are you. We should truly love one another not just giving lip service but actually being it and doing it just as God loves us regardless of the many times we sin against him. And that&#8217;s what Joseph did, he revealed to them who he was and told them not to be afraid because I&#8217;m thinking they were afraid for their lives. If you meet someone you did something awful to, you know you are in trouble because that person will want to give you a taste of your medicine. So they were terrified and Joseph says no worries, forget about everything, you guys actually did me a favor, and you know what???? It was all God&#8217;s doing, he allowed all this to happen because he knew you all would need help and I am your help. \u00a0Isn&#8217;t that amazing?? Whereas sometimes or many times when we are faced with challenges like Joseph did, we want someone to blame instead of taking on that challenge as a blessing, a time to grow, to be pruned (as my husband would say), a time to reflect, and maybe a time to step back relax and come back stronger and wiser and more blessed. A challenge can be a blessing if channeled correctly.<\/p>\n<p>So my dear brothers and sisters, when faced with impossibilities and challenges, remember Joseph went through all that, even being put in prison for something he never did but he rose, he became the head, from the pit that he was, he became a ruler. Rise above whatever it is you are facing and know that the Lord is fighting your battle, you are not alone! Believe it because we serve a mighty mighty God!!

The renewal here referred to by Paul is translated as a &#8220;reforming of the mental disposition of the intellect,&#8221; a complete renovation of the mind and heart. I believe the inner workings of God by His Holy Spirit in the lives of those truly justified by faith are greatly misunderstood today. There is a further, deeper work God desires to do, He desires to renovate our hearts and minds, not just cover them over. The work of the Holy Spirit is not to simply cover us over with the righteousness and holiness of Christ, but to impart within us the very character of Christ, true righteousness and holiness, as we put off the &#8220;old man&#8221; of sin, and &#8220;put on&#8221; the new man. Christ did not come to save us IN our sin, but He came and died to save us FROM our sin, from the very desire and inclination to sin. In order to wallpaper a wall, the existing wallpaper must be removed, otherwise the new paper will not stick well and can bubble and look terrible. Our hearts are the same. God does not desire to simply wallpaper over our old heart, but as Ezekiel 36:26 states, God designs to place within us a new heart and a new spirit, one after His own image. He desires to remove from us the old ways, the inner disposition that is continually set against Him. If He merely covered it over, this disposition would still remain, lurking around every turn, seeking to raise its ugly head every opportunity it could, occupying areas of the heart reserved for God alone. In Galatians 1:19 Paul refers to Christ being formed in us, and in Colossians 1:27 he states that Christ &#8220;in us&#8221; is the hope of glory. It is a change from the inside out, a glorious rebirth in Christ, a second work of grace, not a work we grow into over time, but a work done instantaneously by the Holy Spirit as we present ourselves as living sacrifices. This work of grace makes it possible to love the Lord with all of our heart, mind, and strength, for it removes this nature within us that is set against God and His holiness. There must be a change brothers and sisters. If we are the same spiritually as we were a year ago, something is wrong. So many today live under the title of &#8220;Christian&#8221;, but Christ has long departed, for they refused to go forward, they would rather hold on to the old life, the old ways we are called to forsake. Let today be the day you let go, let God have all of you, lay down your life, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Going onward to the Celestial City, blessings, Brother Ben<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good Morning, Ephesians 4:23-24- and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness.

I&#8217;ve seen people get frustrated because a pastor or someone they considered more anointed did not pray for them leave alone lay hands on them when they were in need. Maybe the pastor sent someone else and they despised that person because they could not see God moving in a mighty way through that person leave alone having faith in God to call on Him while those who came around were to boost their faith. Look at Hezekiah who in the previous chapter spread a letter before the Lord in prayer. In the next chapter, we are told he became ill to the point of death. Isaiah the prophet is sent by God to tell Hezekiah to put his house in order for he was not going to die. Here is what fascinates me, Hezekiah does not send Isaiah the prophet back to God on his behalf, more like an attorney representing him, he chooses to turn to God himself knowing that the same God who heard him when he was to be faced by Sennacherib of the Assyria was the same God who would hear him. Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD, 3 and said, &#8220;Remember now, O LORD, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done what is good in Your sight.&#8221; And Hezekiah wept bitterly&#8221; Isaiah 38:2 Instead of getting frustrated with someone who did not pray for you or thinking that God will not hear your prayers, why not like Hezekiah reach out to God and remind Him of His promises for His children? Take it to the Lord in prayer. He wants to hear from you, your burden, your pain, your concerns, your struggles. You could change the course of your tomorrow, destiny because you cried to God while in trouble. He&#8217;s been waiting to hear from you. 1Peter 5: 6 &#8220;Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, 7 casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you&#8221;. Praying is not a spiritual gift that some people have and some don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s a matter of humility and obedience. And God heard Hezekiah&#8217;s prayer, the same Prophet who brought him bad news, was the same prophet God used to give him good news, vs. 4 And the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying, 5 &#8220;Go and tell Hezekiah, &#8216;Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: &#8220;I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; surely I will add to your days fifteen years. 6 I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.&#8221;&#8216; 7 And this is the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing which He has spoken: 8 Behold, I will bring the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down with the sun on the sundial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.&#8221; So the sun returned ten degrees on the dial by which it had gone down&#8221; Not only did God give him long life, He gave him more than he desired. Ephesians 3:20,&#8221; Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us&#8221;. If Hezekiah did not cry out to God, we know he would have died, but his cry to God changed the course of things. Silent no more or you will miss what God desires to do in your life. Everything to God in prayer.

Here is what the Scriptures tell us what lead Daniel to the lion&#8217;s den.  &#8220;<sup>3<\/sup> Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.<sup> 4<\/sup> At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.<sup> 5<\/sup> Finally these men said, &#8220;We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel<b><u> unless it has something to do with the law of his God<\/u><\/b>.&#8221;  Daniel&#8217;s enemies began to plot against him, manipulating the king to sign a decree stating &#8220;<i>that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions<\/i>. This jealous plot was not unlike the effort against Daniel&#8217;s 3 friends in 3:8ff.  However Daniel was past 80 years of age at this time, yet he was still on his knees thanking God and asking for His guidance and help.   A servant of Jesus seeks the Lord, communes with Him, learns from Him, and obeys Him.  How can one do the will of the Lord, without seeking Him!  Daniel would not allow the death sentence (being thrown in a lion&#8217;s den) deter his prayer life.  Daniel 6:10 reads, &#8220;Now when Daniel<b><u> knew that the writing was signed<\/u><\/b>, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem,<b><u> he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime<\/u><\/b>.  Notice the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">First, he knew the writing was signed, showing he was unashamed (Rom 1:16, and steadfast (1 Cor. 15:58).  Second, he opened the windows, he was bold and humble as he cried out to the Lord (2 Chron. 2:14).  Thirdly, he kneeled three times a day, he was persistent in his prayer life (Luke 18), he gave thanks among the heathen (Psalm 18:49) knowing the consequence could surly be death by a lion&#8217;s den.  Fourthly, he prayed and gave thanks before his God as he did AFORETIME (this was a regular practice for Daniel).  Do any of these characteristics describe you?  I&#8217;m sure if you are living in a free nation, and your life is not on the line (not having the fear of receiving the death sentence as the persecuted church around the world faces).  If death is not a deterrent from you having a prayer life then what is your reason for staying away from the prayer closet?  Is it sleep, friendships, work, household responsibilities, laziness, etc\u2026?  Now ask yourself does even one of these compare to facing death?   Do you serve Jesus on your terms or his, by examining your prayer life?  Are you consistent in prayer, are you bold in your witness, do you thank the Lord?  When Daniel was placed into the lion&#8217;s den, the unbelieving king  , &#8220;\u2026arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions.<sup> <\/sup><\/span><sup>\ufeff<\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">20<\/span>\ufeff<\/sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> And when he came to the den, he cried out with a <\/span>\ufeff\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">lamenting voice to Daniel\u2026 &#8220;<b><u>Daniel, servant of the living God<\/u><\/b>, <\/span>\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">has your God,<b><u> whom you serve continually<\/u><\/b>, been able to deliver you from the lions?&#8221;  Daniel was known by the ungodly for being a servant of God.

It&#8217;s been said that the world is discipling the church rather than the church going into all the world and making disciples.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">In the book of Daniel, we are introduced to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah  which are Hebrew young men exiled into idolatrous nation of Babylon which served false gods.  These four Hebrew boys would have to find a way to serve God in a culture, among a people that did not normally serve Him.  Daniel chapter one informs us that these four were &#8220;Children in whom<i> was<\/i> no blemish, but well favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as<i> had<\/i> ability in them to stand in the king&#8217;s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.&#8221;  Daniel&#8217;s heart was set on serving God.  It is interesting that Daniel equated himself as a servant of the king as long as it did not clash with His servanthood of God. &#8220;But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king&#8217;s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself (1:8).  Daniel chose to serve His God even when it was not comfortable him, because it was not about the servant, but about the One in whom Daniel served.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Serving God lead Daniel to the lion&#8217;s den, and lead Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah to the fiery furnace.  Many seem to feel that when one serves God, life will be smooth because God is pleased.  In the case of among Daniel and his friends, the king would soon recognize the resolve of God&#8217;s servants as they serve Him faithfully, despite the consequences, even in the face of death.  When a decree was made by the king, and Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah refused to worship the statue of the king, they<sup> &#8220;<\/sup>answered and said to the king, &#8220;O Nebuchadnezzar, <\/span>\ufeff\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">we have no need to answer you in this matter.<sup> <\/sup><\/span><sup>\ufeff<\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">17<\/span>\ufeff<\/sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> If that<i> is the case,<\/i> our <\/span>\ufeff<sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">k<\/span><\/sup>\ufeff<b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">God whom we serve is able to <\/span>\ufeff<\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">deliver us from the burning fiery furnace<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">, and He will deliver<i> us<\/i> from your hand, O king.<sup> <\/sup><\/span><sup>\ufeff<\/sup><sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">18<\/span>\ufeff<\/sup><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> But<b><u> if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods<\/u><\/b>, nor will we <\/span>\ufeff\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">worship the gold image which you have set up.&#8221;  Wow, what a resolve!  They are ultimately thrown into the furnace and, &#8220;Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,<b><u> ye servants of the most high God<\/u><\/b>, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.&#8221;  When serving the Lord we learn from their lives the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">First God is able to bring deliverance in our most seemingly horrific of circumstances.  Secondly, we must believe God, for it is in Him that we must put our trust.  We may have no idea how God could deliver us from what looks like doom from our perspective, but we must not forget we serve an all powerful God!  Thirdly, we must speak to the ungodly about the deliverance of God, and our resolve in Him.  We are to proclaim that no matter what, we will not bow down to cultural expectations that violate the Word of God, even when our stance will be seen by the majority as an unpopular decision.  We don&#8217;t serve God to be popular with man, but to be obedient to our Lord!  Fourthly, we must stay together through the trials; we really do need one another.  The Hebrew boys faced the trial together, and through it together.  What a great story they lived, that we now read about.  Who know our stories, read our stories, and watch our stories?  Fifthly, will the ungodly recognize that we are servants of the Lord by the stands that we take in various circumstances?  Will we truly refuse ungodly rules that violate God&#8217;s Word, despite the consequence!  It&#8217;s easy to serve God until you are challenged by law, pressure, etc\u2026, to violate your professed service to God.  Your faith must stand trial, and when it does, whose servant will you look like, as there are only two choices.  Meditate on these things, and examine if you are a servant of the Most High God.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Phil (Evangelist)<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, We live in a world that tells us to serve the society that we live in.

Many people have jobs, families, hobbies, school, homes, and a plethora of responsibilities, so since God knows our heart, He should understand right?  <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Jesus came to visit the sisters of Lazarus in their home one day and in the midst of his visit this whole issue of busyness, and serving Jesus rose to the forefront of His visitation.  Jesus enters the home of the sisters and upon doing so each one responded to Jesus in a particular manner.  Martha began to become cumbered (distracted) with much serving, and proceeded to question Jesus saying, &#8220;Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?  It seemed that the conversation centered on the value of sitting which is how Mary chose to respond to Jesus&#8217; visit as opposed to serving, which is how Martha reacts to Christ&#8217;s arrival.  Martha, seemingly feeling that she chose the better and perhaps more reverend option, attempts to force Jesus hand by requesting that He tell Mary to join Martha and serve Jesus alongside her.  Perhaps if Mary would serve the foods, sweep the floor, or perform any helpful task, this would lighten Martha&#8217;s work load and therefore, help the work move along more quickly.  <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">There is in fact always enough time to accomplish our God given tasks, and also to spend time with God Himself, if one seeks first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness (Matt 6:33).  We must have Kingdom priorities, God&#8217;s Kingdom must come, our kingdom must go.  In prayer the Twelve were instructed to pray, &#8220;Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done.&#8221;  In the Ten Commandments, God wrote, <i> I am<\/i> the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, \ufeff<sup>c<\/sup>\ufeffout of the house of \ufeff<sup>1<\/sup>\ufeffbondage.  \ufeff&#8221;You shall have no other gods before Me.&#8221;  When asked by a scribe which was the greatest Commandment, Jesus responded by saying, &#8220;The \ufeff\ufefffirst of all the commandments<i> is:<\/i> \ufeff<i>&#8216;Hear, O Israel, the Lord<\/i> our God, the Lord is one.<sup> <\/sup><sup>\ufeff<\/sup><sup>30\ufeff<\/sup><i> And you shall<\/i> \ufeff<sup>r<\/sup>\ufefflove the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.&#8217; \ufeff<sup>3<\/sup>\ufeffThis<i> is<\/i> the first commandment (Mark 12:30).&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Mary to have kept these things in mind in prioritizing the things of God, showing Jesus Himself in this case amidst her choice to be with Jesus instead of doing chores for Jesus.  Jesus didn&#8217;t repel Martha away, but rather attempted to use the scenario to show Martha that when Christ is present both made a decision as to how they would respond to Jesus&#8217; presence in their home.  Jesus said that &#8220;Mary chose the better decision sitting at his feet rather than Martha who served at His side (Luke 10:41-42).&#8221;  In the area of servant hood, a true servant does the will of the one that is being served.  Hence servant hood must be on Christ&#8217;s terms and not ours.  Let me illustrate.

Do we involve Him as the people in the wedding at Cana had ? Many do not like to involve Jesus in their day today events\u2026There are certain areas which people reserve for themselves and would not like him to interfere with due to various reasons\u2026 thinking HE is only the God to be worshipped ..or we can pray in times of calamity but rather He is our God in our daily lives. in every practical situation\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Let us be aware of the fact that if He is invited into minute detailed life and also His leadership is accepted, we can be rest assured that with what He has done in my life is an experience I can share because not only is He invited, He is also involved\/informed .Praise God\u2026<\/p>\n<p>The major thing in the wedding, wine being served suddenly ran out. Now the hosts were in a very embarrassing situation. We can imagine the wedding with all guests, dignitaries, relatives and so on\u2026 and in the peak moments they could not be served due to shortage\u2026Jesus was invited and informed, He had showed them the way out of this lack situation <b>,&#8221;I am the way , the truth and the life<\/b>&#8221; \u2026. He delivered a command to fill six jars with water up to the brim. Seemed ridiculous to fill water when there was shortage of wine ! Though it seemed simple, God&#8217;s power started working once His command was obeyed. Obedience leads to unleashing of Gods power\u2026.When Namaan was asked by prophet Elisha to dip in the River Jordan seven times, he was enraged but later when he obeyed the command, he was healed\u2026Command may look funny or nonsensical but it is the WORD OF GOD which has the power to create everything out of nothing \u2026Now when the wine was then served and taken to the master of the banquet, he was surprised cause the taste was the best , better than the one served earlier.

Faith was their armor. A man was afraid of the enemy stood to encourage them and this is what he said <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">, 20&#8243; \u2026, &#8220;Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem:<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Believe in the Lord your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> Instead of telling them to fight, he told them to believe God to be established and to believe His sent servants the prophets and they would prosper. This encouragement was not for one time event. That is true courage which faith inspires a man with; nor will any thing contribute more to the establishing of the heart in shaking times than a firm belief of the power, and mercy, and promise of God. Isaiah 26:3, &#8220;You will keep him in perfect peace, Whose mind is stayed on You, Because he trusts in You&#8221; <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Vs 21, &#8220;And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the Lord,<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> \ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> and who should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying:&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">There is something about adding songs of praise to your faith. I believe songs keep faith a live as they remind you of who God is and what He is able to do. I have seen people sing when they were nervous which helped them calm down. Something happens when we sing praises to God in the midst of our situations. The world may teach you to sing and celebrate after the victory, here we are singing because He is Victorious. If they were not going to fight in this battle, they didn&#8217;t want to just stand there and do nothing, they thought, &#8220;why not praise God for who He is, His goodness, His mercies, His faithfulness etc&#8221; and the bible says <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">, vs. 22 &#8220;<\/span><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Now when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the people<\/span><\/u> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">&#8220;. Amen, the moment they began to sing and praise the Lord, the Lord set an ambush against their enemies and caused them to destroy each other. If you come to a battle field where your fight is not required, break out into singing and praising God because breakthroughs also comes through praise and worship to God. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">24 &#8220;So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and there were their dead bodies, fallen on the earth. No one had escaped 25 When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much. 26 <\/span><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed the LORD<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah until this day. 27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, <\/span><u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">to go back to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">. 28<\/span><u> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">So they came to Jerusalem, with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets, to the house of the LORD<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">. 29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel. <\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">They did not see the fight in the battle field but they saw the results. They knew God had defeated their enemies. They received double for their trouble and they came back rejoicing for the Lord had given them victory over their enemies. <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">1John 5:4, &#8220;For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world our faith.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Only God could be faithful to do what they couldn&#8217;t do and only God is faithful to do the same for us.

Isaiah 26:3, &#8220;You will keep him in perfect peace, Whose mind is stayed on You, Because he trusts in You&#8221; <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Vs 21, &#8220;And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the Lord,<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> \ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> and who should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying:&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">There is something about adding songs of praise to your faith. I believe songs keep faith a live as they remind you of who God is and what He is able to do. I have seen people sing when they were nervous which helped them calm down. Something happens when we sing praises to God in the midst of our situations. The world may teach you to sing and celebrate after the victory, here we are singing because He is Victorious. If they were not going to fight in this battle, they didn&#8217;t want to just stand there and do nothing, they thought, &#8220;why not praise God for who He is, His goodness, His mercies, His faithfulness etc&#8221; and the bible says <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">, vs. 22 &#8220;<\/span><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Now when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the people<\/span><\/u> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">&#8220;. Amen, the moment they began to sing and praise the Lord, the Lord set an ambush against their enemies and caused them to destroy each other. If you come to a battle field where your fight is not required, break out into singing and praising God because breakthroughs also comes through praise and worship to God. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">24 &#8220;So when Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and there were their dead bodies, fallen on the earth. No one had escaped 25 When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away their spoil, they found among them an abundance of valuables on the dead bodies, and precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering the spoil because there was so much. 26 <\/span><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed the LORD<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah until this day. 27 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat in front of them, <\/span><u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">to go back to Jerusalem with joy, for the LORD had made them rejoice over their enemies<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">. 28<\/span><u> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">So they came to Jerusalem, with stringed instruments and harps and trumpets, to the house of the LORD<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">. 29 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they heard that the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel. <\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">They did not see the fight in the battle field but they saw the results. They knew God had defeated their enemies. They received double for their trouble and they came back rejoicing for the Lord had given them victory over their enemies. <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">1John 5:4, &#8220;For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world our faith.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Only God could be faithful to do what they couldn&#8217;t do and only God is faithful to do the same for us. Therefore call on Him, be vulnerable, set your eyes on Him, Heed to His word, have Faith, sing praises to His name. My prayer is for this year to be victorious as I put to practice the principles from 2Chronicles 20. <\/span><b><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Thanks<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Evans<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Chronicles 20:1-30, vs. \ufeff12 \ufeff O our God, will You not \ufeffjudge them?

Fear threatens faith and God has given us what we need to combat fear, <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">2 Timothy 1:7, &#8220;For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">He told Abraham, Hagar, Joshua, the children of Israel, Elijah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Joseph, Mary, Paul, the disciples etc. to fear not, do not be afraid because God knows that one battle his people have is the battle of fear. Fear of loosing someone, fear of being abandoned, fear of danger, fear of failing etc, This is why He dealt with fear first to get it out of the way that faith may prevail. The same message came to Jehoshaphat, God dealt with His fear then gave His word, <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">&#8220;for the battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">What a relief, what a blessing to know His words makes a difference.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> Isaiah 41:10, &#8220;Fear not, for I am with you; Be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand&#8221; <\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Amen, if the battle is the Lord&#8217;s, then we don&#8217;t need to fight and no need to go to the battle ground, there is no work for us to do there.

If the battle is the Lord&#8217;s and He tells us to go against what brought us fear, the reason we came to Him in the first place, then this is an indication we are not going in our own might and also, it&#8217;s an indication that we can fight scared without retreating or surrendering. It&#8217;s easy to want victory while sitting down but I say, victory comes when you have sought the Lord and the Lord tells you to go against the impossible. It&#8217;s at this battleground that you see victories unfold before your eyes. It&#8217;s in this battlefield that you see the mountains melt like wax in His presence. All the people I mentioned before who were told not to be afraid, still showed up in their own battle fields and so will we. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">Isn&#8217;t it interesting that the Lord told them to go against the army without preparation, explanation or strategies? Then He says, go against them but don&#8217;t fight just stand? Only God would say things that sound foolish and do not make sense and still be trusted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">When you don&#8217;t know what to do and He tells you to do what you couldn&#8217;t do, be encouraged that He has a plan. The reason He is bringing you to the battlefield you want to run away from is to demonstrate to you His power. It gives a chance for the situation to know why God is present in it, because of you and in spite of you. <\/span><b><\/b><a href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?book_id=52&amp;chapter=8&amp;verse=37&amp;version=50&amp;context=verse\" target=\"_blank\"><b><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;color:#0000ff;\">Romans 8:37<\/span><\/b><b><\/b><\/a><b><\/b><b><\/b><b><\/b><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">, &#8220;Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">We only concur what He has concurred, that is how we become more than conquerors.

Anytime the Lord wanted to do something in someone&#8217;s life, you always hear him deal with fear first. We all deal with fears at certain levels and degrees. This is one of the weapons the enemy uses to cripple believers because he is the captain of fear. Fear threatens faith and God has given us what we need to combat fear, <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">2 Timothy 1:7, &#8220;For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">He told Abraham, Hagar, Joshua, the children of Israel, Elijah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Joseph, Mary, Paul, the disciples etc. to fear not, do not be afraid because God knows that one battle his people have is the battle of fear. Fear of loosing someone, fear of being abandoned, fear of danger, fear of failing etc, This is why He dealt with fear first to get it out of the way that faith may prevail. The same message came to Jehoshaphat, God dealt with His fear then gave His word, <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">&#8220;for the battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">What a relief, what a blessing to know His words makes a difference.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> Isaiah 41:10, &#8220;Fear not, for I am with you; Be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, Yes, I will help you, I will uphold you with My righteous right hand&#8221; <\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Amen, if the battle is the Lord&#8217;s, then we don&#8217;t need to fight and no need to go to the battle ground, there is no work for us to do there. Wait, read what the continuous message vs. 16, <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">&#8220;<sup><\/sup><\/span><sup><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Tomorrow go down AGAINST them.

If the battle is the Lord&#8217;s and He tells us to go against what brought us fear, the reason we came to Him in the first place, then this is an indication we are not going in our own might and also, it&#8217;s an indication that we can fight scared without retreating or surrendering. It&#8217;s easy to want victory while sitting down but I say, victory comes when you have sought the Lord and the Lord tells you to go against the impossible. It&#8217;s at this battleground that you see victories unfold before your eyes. It&#8217;s in this battlefield that you see the mountains melt like wax in His presence. All the people I mentioned before who were told not to be afraid, still showed up in their own battle fields and so will we. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">Isn&#8217;t it interesting that the Lord told them to go against the army without preparation, explanation or strategies? Then He says, go against them but don&#8217;t fight just stand? Only God would say things that sound foolish and do not make sense and still be trusted. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">When you don&#8217;t know what to do and He tells you to do what you couldn&#8217;t do, be encouraged that He has a plan.

When he sought to seek the Lord you can see that he is assembling Judah and Jerusalem that they may all seek the Lord. I can imagine him praying, &#8220;Lord for the sake of these people you have given me to lead, please hear our cry&#8221;. <\/span><b><\/b><b><\/b><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Instead of exhausting every means before calling on God, he called on God first without exploring any other means.<\/span> <\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">A few chapters before this in<\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> 2 Chronicles 7:14<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">preps them for what they are about to face<\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">, &#8220;14 if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. <\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">As we shared yesterday, king Jehoshaphat understood who God was, what He had done, what he had promised.

When you don&#8217;t know what to do, remember what the Lord has done by reminding Him of them and the promises He has made in His word. This is not suggesting that the Lord forgets and we need to remind Him, this is for us to remember and say to the Lord that we remember His promises through His word. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">12<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> &#8220;O our God, will You not<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">judge them?

One thing that I find tough to admit is my inability. Inability may give a sign of weakness. For us to come to the Lord, we are going to declare bankrupt and be vulnerable to admit like Jehoshaphat, &#8221; <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">we (I) have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us (me)&#8221;<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">and not be afraid to admit it. We are not going to pretend that everything is fine when they are not and live in denial. I know people may say stay positive, refuse to admit you have a problem or there is a problem and it will go away.

I can imagine him praying, &#8220;Lord for the sake of these people you have given me to lead, please hear our cry&#8221;. <\/span><b><\/b><b><\/b><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">Instead of exhausting every means before calling on God, he called on God first without exploring any other means.<\/span> <\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">A few chapters before this in<\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> 2 Chronicles 7:14<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">preps them for what they are about to face<\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">, &#8220;14 if My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. <\/span><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">As we shared yesterday, king Jehoshaphat understood who God was, what He had done, what he had promised. One of the things he remembers is<\/span><b><\/b><b><\/b><b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">in  vs. 11,<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">where he says,<\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> &#8220;here they are (the enemy), rewarding us <\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">by coming to throw us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> &#8220;. When you don&#8217;t know what to do, remember what the Lord has done by reminding Him of them and the promises He has made in His word. This is not suggesting that the Lord forgets and we need to remind Him, this is for us to remember and say to the Lord that we remember His promises through His word. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">12<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\"> &#8220;O our God, will You not<\/span> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">\ufeff<\/span><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">judge them?

One thing that I find tough to admit is my inability. Inability may give a sign of weakness. For us to come to the Lord, we are going to declare bankrupt and be vulnerable to admit like Jehoshaphat, &#8221; <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">we (I) have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us (me)&#8221;<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-size:85%;\">and not be afraid to admit it. We are not going to pretend that everything is fine when they are not and live in denial. I know people may say stay positive, refuse to admit you have a problem or there is a problem and it will go away. You know what? there is nothing wrong with admitting you have a situation that is overwhelming and tough to deal with <\/span><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">.

Jesus did not change the surrounding for Peter to fit in, He made Peter to fit in a surrounding that had turmoil and chaos. There was heavy waves rocking their boat yet he walked on what he could have been sinking in. When our eyes are upon the Lord, <\/span><u><\/u><u><b><\/b><\/u><u><b><\/b><\/u><u><b><span style=\"font-size:85%;\">we can ride out what we could have been sinking in while we wait for Him to bring us through.<\/span> <\/b><\/u><b><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;font-size:85%;\">When you don&#8217;t know what to do, admit it and confess it to the Lord then keep your eyes on Him more than you keep your eyes on the obstacle.

When you know a person very well, if  someone else came to you and began to talk about that person in a different way, most likely your response would be, &#8220;I know so and so very well, and what you are saying about him does not sound like him&#8221;. Everyone is defined by who they are and not what they say. Who they are should accompany what they say. There is a great difference between BEING versus DOING. <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Being is a life style while doing depends on the surrounding. <\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Integrity has been defined and broken in four parts in the dictionary. Before I can break them in parts, how about we define them first.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Integrity is steadfast adherence to a strict moral<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">or ethical code, it&#8217;s also a state of being unimpaired; soundness,<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">it&#8217;s also the quality or condition of being whole or undivided; completeness<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">. To my understanding, integrity has nothing to do with seasons, it has everything to do with what one believes which must be the right thing and living by the standards set. They are steadfast meaning un movable, they are strict moral which is conforming to standards of what is right or in just behavior. I came a cross this study guide that breaks this parts as <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">incorruptibility, soundness, completeness and honesty<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">. A person of integrity would have all these four things circulating in their lives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">People also have other individuals they admire in life and if you were to put down the things that you admire about them, you will come to discover that the entire list reflects on <u><\/u><\/span><u><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">who the person is rather that what he or she does or has done<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\"> simply because character and integrity are highly valued and yet very rare in this world we live in. With knowing about the world and how people with integrity are very rare, we as believers are expected by the Almighty God to be a people of integrity or becoming for that is the goal set for us. <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Psalm 7:8, &#8220;The Lord shall judge the peoples; judge me, O Lord according to my righteousness, and according to my<\/span><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\"> integrity within me<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Integrity is very significant in our lives and we ought to take it seriously for it&#8217;s not necessarily man who look at it but God who designed it. See we will be judged by the integrity within us a result of what we had looked at earlier, incorruptibility, soundness, completeness and honesty. Are these the things we strive for so as to be men and women of integrity?. A people who have a stand for what is right and will not bend at any cost for we are striving to live by God&#8217;s standards. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">The text provided on top begins by saying a good man (a man of character), A person is always described as good or bad by their character. We hear so and so is a person of good character or bad character and the Lord takes the time to tell us about a good man and an evil man. <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Luke 6:43, &#8220;For a good tree does not bear bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit vs. 44 For every tree is known by it&#8217;s fruit&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">It is a simple as that, you only bear what you are and so if you are good (a person of character), out of the treasures of your heart, you will bring forth that which is good for it&#8217;s a reflection of what is inside.<\/span> <u><\/u><u><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Your inside defines your character, maintaining and living by it cause you to be a person of integrity<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">. We all have been given good treasures only that some have corrupted the treasures, soiled it and now they are corruptible, unstable, incomplete and dishonest. Jesus Christ&#8217;s integrity and character is our goal for we know that He is the vine and we are the branches, it&#8217;s in our abiding that we become who He is because He is the treasure hidden in our hearts. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Being a man or a woman of integrity is a pursuit not optional, It&#8217;s a road that all must take to become. We are known by our substance which is reflected by the evidence of our fruits. The last portion of the scripture given on the top says, &#8221; <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">for off the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh&#8221;.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">You and I cannot speak what we don&#8217;t have within otherwise we will be deceiving ourselves and the people around us.

Luke 2:22, King James<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Everyone dreams of becoming something, or having success or loving someone and or marrying that someone or going somewhere or achieving some goals etc., that they believe will make them happy. These are some of the dreams and desires which, when fulfilled, add excitement, joy and happiness in our lives. God, our Heavenly Father wants us to joyous, successful and happy. However, most of the time, we don&#8217;t actualize these. We often face unpredictable challenges, traps and even danger that in some cases kill our dreams and us. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">We have an enemy whose mission is to steal, kill and destroy (John 10:10).<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">He does not care who we are or where we are. He will make every attempt to kill us. He schemes plans everyday to track us down to either stop us from being what God meant for us to be or kill us. But, the good news is, <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;we are safe with God, even in the valley of the shadow of death\u2026we shall fear no evil because God is with us.&#8221; (Psalms 23) He also will guide our way<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\"> . At times, He will change our plans or routes that we intended to take. For instance, He may let you go to a career you never wanted or marry someone you never thought you could marry or lead you to at own or city you never wanted to live in. He may at times instruct you to move from somewhere or out of a relationship with someone you feel you love for or care about. But whatever He does or instruct you to do, His intention is always good. <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">He will only change your plans that may not fit in with his will for you<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">He will also change routes if he sees danger a head on the way you are going<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">. He will instruct or warn you not to do something or head another way. It is important, therefore, for us the children of God to be flexible and willing to change route or our plans when God tells us to. How then can we know his will? Well His will is His word. Listen to the word. Listen to good counsel. Listen to yourself and, align what you are listening to the word. If you obey, you may save yourself from future pain, failure or hardship or death. Don&#8217;t insist on your ways always. Don&#8217;t have the mentality most people have &#8221; <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">my way or no way.&#8221;<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Don&#8217;t compromise to please people or pride yourself to death. And don&#8217;t think that you are very &#8220;mature&#8221; and &#8220;strong&#8221; and that you can make it alone. None of us is, we all need God&#8217;s leading because he, alone, knows the way that we take. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Job said<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">&#8221; He knows the way that I take, after he has tried me, I shall come forth like gold&#8221; (Job 23:10).<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Do you believe that God knows the way or road or path that you need to follow into your future dreams? Do you believe that God has a good plan for you to give you your expectation (Jeremiah 29:11)? If you believe God and all his promises, then let go of yourself and let God change your plans and lead you to any path He may choose whether you understand it or not. Heed to his warnings and you shall live and stay out of a lot of troubles and traps of Satan. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">If you don&#8217;t, you may miss or loose something. For example:<\/span> <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Samson lost his divine power, eyes and finally died tragically, because he didn&#8217;t heed God&#8217;s and his parent&#8217;s warning and advise not to love and marry Philistine women;<\/span> <\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Saul lost his kingship career, was rejected by God and died in battle, a tragic death <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Many children of Israelites died in the wilderness because they ignored God&#8217;s instruction, and his servant Moses&#8217; leadership:<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">If you heed God&#8217;s warnings, and follow, His instructions, be willing to change route yourself or let Him do so at will, you will avoid a lot of, if not all, obstacles in life including premature death or evil Satan may bring your way and mine. For example: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">The Wise men, who announced the good new of Jesus&#8217; birth, went back to their country through a different route. God warned them not to go to Herod. They escaped death!<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Joseph and his young wife and infant (baby Jesus) escaped to Egypt, through a different route, and had their baby escape infanticide by the hand of Herod.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;\u2026Rise, take your child and his mother and escape to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you \u2026And he arose and took the child and his mother by night.

I mean some thing you really would love to have or see and then all over sudden, something happens and you couldn\u2019t have it or see it. That usually triggers disappointment that can degenerate into discouragement and serious depression. Is there anything that can be done before getting that far? That depends on what choices and decisions you make. You can let obstacles get over your roof and tear you down or you can chose to climb over the rooftops of your obstacles, tear them down, and zoom right into the presence of Christ for your miracle.<b> \u201c\u2026 I have set before you this day life and death, blessings and cursing, chose life\u2026\u201d(Deut.30-30).<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">There are four people the Bible talks about in the Gospel of Mark 2, who could not allow anything to stop them from reaching Jesus so they could fulfill a promise they had given to a paralytic man they had picked from the street where he was begging. These four men had faith in Jesus. They believed that Jesus could heal the paralytic and set him free so he could move on with a normal and productive happy life. They told the paralytic about Jesus and the man liked the idea. So, they trekked down the dusty road, and finally reached the house where Jesus was teaching and preaching the kingdom of God. When they arrived, the house was full to capacity and the crowd could not allow them to pass through to Jesus. What did they do?<b> They made a faith decision, no obstacle was going to stop them from seeing Jesus. They climbed the rooftop, tore the roof, tied the paralytic man with a rope and lowered him as fast as they could right in front of Jesus.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">When Jesus saw their faith, he said, \u201cSon, your sins are forgiven you.\u201d<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\"> Note what he saw-<b>their faith<\/b>. That made him to stop what he was doing to give the men who had faith what they badly needed-the restoration of the paralytic\u2019s health and extension of his life. He saw and honored their faith. He didn\u2019t even bother to ask them who they were and where they had come from or why they had committed a property damage crime. He didn\u2019t yell at them for disturbing his meeting and changing his program. He gave them what they came for and claimed by faith and by all means.<u> <\/u><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">The decisions taken by the four men and the paralytic exhibits faith, courage and determination, without which they could not have gone passed the crowed to Jesus. If we also want to see Jesus, and bring all our cares to him, we must make up our mind that we will climb over the rooftops of anything, including: doubts, fear, ignorance, pride, confusion, disappointment, poverty or wealth, laziness, lies, un-forgiveness, bitterness, racism, religion, traditions, etc. And tear them down and lower ourselves in God\u2019s presence. Then, we will receive whatever we have need of according to His will. The Bible says that if we humble ourselves under the mighty hands of God, he will lift us up in due season. That won\u2019t happen if we are not decided, determined, and courageous enough to take drastic steps of faith for overcoming any obstacle we may face in life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">Have a victorious day!!! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:10px;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1John 5:4, &#8220;He that is born of God overcomes the world and this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith&#8221;.

Be blessed. Our main text, from the Bible, is found in the book of Joshua 6: 1-27. I recommend that you read the whole chapter, after work, quietly and meditate on it. God will reveal more great things to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">First, let me say that in life, there are obstacles that will not be easily plowed through or problems that will be solved quickly or instantly. But they can be solved and will be resolved, if the right strategy or approach is used. In most cases, a great deal of spiritual weapons and personal qualities or virtues are necessary for overcoming deeply rooted, and tough to move, change or plow through. One of these virtues that anybody hopping to go the long haul with an obstacle is:<b> Patience<\/b>. Let me repeat it: Patieeeeeeeence! Someone once said,<b> \u201cPatience is a tree whose roots are bitter, but its fruits are sweet.\u201d<\/b> It is also said that,<b> \u201cPatience it the Queen of virtues.\u201d<\/b> When this queen is joined together with,<b> \u201cFaith\u201d, king of virtues<\/b>, there is no obstacle or problem or difficulty or circumstance that can stand on their way. Everything bows before them, and departs with great regrets, sorrow and disappointment. They turn<b> disappointment into appointment<\/b> with God for achievement of your dreams and arrival at your destiny. In order to develop these virtues, you must get accustomed to doing three things consistently:<b> 1.) You must trust God, 2.) You must communicate (prayer) with God, 1.) You must listen to God, mostly, through His word-the Bible. <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">In our today\u2019s text, Joshua, who was leading the Israelites to their conquest faced an impossible obstacle- Jericho City. They could not move a head without passing through Jericho. The wall of Jericho was very high and firm. The foundation of the wall was carefully and strongly laid, reinforced such that the children of Israel could not, whatsoever, enter to attack and destroy and loot the good stuff that was locked in there. Can you imagine the frustration of Joshua and the Israelites? <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">If you have faced some things that just blocked you so that no matter what you did or didn\u2019t do, you couldn\u2019t move on or make progress or have breakthrough, then you may empathize with these children of God. Remember, I didn\u2019t say \u201csympathize.\u201d (Personally I don\u2019t like that word that much. Sympathy is one of those commodities I don\u2019t consume that much and I don\u2019t enjoy very much the company of people who offer me sympathy for whatever reason). Anyway, that is beside the point. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">Anyway, how did Joshua and his people overcome the wall of Jericho? The Bible says that God gave them a strategy. He told them to gather together and quietly go round the city seven time for seven days. And on the seventh day, they would shout with a big shout, blowing their trumpets. And when they did that, the scripture says \u201c \u2026<b>, the people shouted\u2026and it came to pass, when the people heard, and the people shouted with a great shout, THAT THE WALL FELL FLAT, SO THAT THE PEOPLE WENT UP INTO THE CITY\u2026AND THE TOOK THE CITY.\u201d (vs.20).<\/b> Amen!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">What a simple, stupid, senseless, childish and irrational strategy God gave Joshua. How could he and his troop, as intelligent and sensible as all of them were, believe what God said? Well, they didn\u2019t care whether it made sense or not, they just acted it and got the result. Sometimes God will say things to you that don\u2019t make sense.<b> Victory from God is won by faith not by understanding or working hard or by use of powerful things or even people<\/b>.<b> The just shall live by faith\u2026not by works<\/b>. Today many of you are probably facing obstacles that you have tried to overcome for a long time but you have not been able. Listen to God and start going round the obstacle. You may have to do that continuously for a long time. May be seven hours, or seven days, or weeks or months or even years. Don\u2019t give up. Each time you go round it, you are weakening the walls of your obstacles. They will soon fall down, never again to be seen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">Have a blessed going around your wall day!!! <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:10px;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u201c And the Lord said to Joshua, SEE, I HAVE GIVEN INTO YOUR HAND JERICHO\u2026AND YOU SHALL COMPASS THE CITY\u2026AND GO ROUND ABOUT THE CITY ONCE.

Moses had done his best by the grace of God to bring them out of the land to the mountain where they could serve the Lord. One thing I love about Moses is that even though God sent Him which is a sign of God\u2019s approval, He still understood something about the presence of God and he says in<b> Exodus 33:15, &#8220;And he said unto Him, if Your presence does not go with us (me), do not bring us up from here&#8221;<\/b>. We are starting a new year and our prayer and desire like Moses is the presence of God go with us and before us. In as much as Moses knew God would give him victory, He desired more of God&#8217;s presence. His presence alone was a comfort to him and his people already. Are you purposing in your life not to make a move without allowing the presence of God to go with you? I thank God for Moses for he brought the children of Israel out of the land of less than enough to a land of just enough (God provided manna) this is the mountain where the Israelites got comfortable. God intentions from the beginning was to bring them to a land of more than enough. At that time Joshua was one of the most powerful warriors under Moses&#8217; leadership. As God was using Moses, Joshua was also being blessed and he observed how God had given them victory through this man Moses. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">When Moses disobeyed God because of the people he was leading, God told him that he will see the land He promised the Israelites but He will not step into it.  If God was not going to allow Moses to go to the land, He had to raise someone else and that is where Joshua comes in. He tells Joshua, &#8220;<b>Moses my servant is dead<\/b>&#8220;, the man I used is gone, he did great things while I was with him but He is gone, the year 2007 God used different things and people to reach out to you, several methods were used to bring you out of your Egypt but all those are now gone, they are dead, they cannot bring you and I to the next level. Thank God that they worked then but this is a new year, new strategies. Don&#8217;t get frustrated when God begins to use new things and not the former things you knew about. God is not going to use the same thing to do something new for He has a lot of ways of accomplishing much in your life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">What we may have been looking at as the means God was going to use to move us is gone, but thank God for Joshua. Joshua became Moses successor  who was ready to accomplish what Moses had started. Moses was a leader, while Joshua was a warrior, Joshua had been under Moses ministry but now he is put on the front line. We are blessed to know that God is still pushing us from the lower levels to higher levels. Being given new tasks, taking ownership, taking a stand and knowing God has a plan.<b> Joshua 1:2, &#8220;Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them&#8221;.<\/b> Where we are going, we are not going alone but taking company with us. Christians are nomadic people, we are always on the move.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">Joshua 1:1-18, &#8220;&#8230;as I was with Moses, so I will be with you<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';font-size:10px;\">&#8220;, Praise God for He has assured us of His presence even as we start a new year. That as I was with you when I used different plans to get you out, I will be with you when I execute new plans to take you that far. Forget about the failures of the previous year and embrace what God wants to do in the new year.

They are not the only ones, nor are they the super strategies for overcoming all of life&#8217;s obstacles we face daily. <b>But they are good and godly, and are time tested, as the Bible will prove and as some of us will confirm from our testimonies and past experiences and victories God have given us. I will begin today by examining the first strategy or approach: <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><u><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Plowing Through The Obstacle<\/span><\/u><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">,<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">When faced with an obstacle, small or big, our common reaction is usually a response or a reaction. Reaction seems to be the option most of us prefer because, I guess, it is cheap since no much thought or consideration or concentration or efforts are necessary. For instance, if you are facing a disappointment as an obstacle, you can simply deal with it by deciding to give up or quit or cry afoul or curse. Worse, you can choose to sink and drown in the deep ocean of depression, where hopelessness and frustration are manifested in large quantity free of charge. Now that&#8217;s very dangerous, because most people don&#8217;t get out of that sea senile or at, worse, a live. You know that. Don&#8217;t you? Try not to be a statistic. Don&#8217;t go there. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">But what about &#8220;response&#8221; to an obstacle? I mean in a positive manner that is likely to produce the best and most desirable and victorious result? That may demand a lot more than any reactions I have already mentioned. It may mean making a conscious decision, however risky or painful or hard or challenging the obstacle may be, that you are going to &#8220;plow&#8221; right through it. Your choices and decisions determine the outcome. Your dependence on God for help guarantees the victory, which is usually accompanied by a lot of joy and celebrations. Listen to what the Psalmist wrote: <\/span><b><i><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">&#8221; Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy comes in the morning (Psalms 30:5). <\/span><\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">There is a morning that always comes for those who decide to go through their obstacle, even when they are weeping so hard. They know that the weeping is just but for a night. Don&#8217;t let Satan lie to you that your obstacle is unique and special, just newly invented and that you do not have the ability and capacity to overcome it. Our God is able. His specialty is deliverance. His presence alone, even without doing anything or saying anything, melts any obstacle or problem. He is also a good road constructor. He makes ways where roads never existed and no Engineer could ever imagine a road could be constructed.  Come with me to the Bank of the Red Sea and see how He did that to Moses and the children of Israel, when they faced the impossible to &#8220;plow&#8221; through -The Red Sea.  Read Exodus 14, and see what God can do. It records one of the most spectacular and incredible miracle of victory over and a gigantic and life threatening obstacle. <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">The first thing God said to the Israelites was &#8221; stand still&#8221; and see my &#8221; salvation which I am going to show you today.&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\"> In other words, don&#8217;t panic or be scared. I am with you and I am in control of the situation. The reality was they were scared to death, because Pharaoh&#8217;s soldiers were behind them ready to kill them or recapture them and take them the back to slavery and the Red Sea was in front of them. Now, look, these guys were in a&#8221; fix&#8221;. But God was not scared! <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Anytime you face an obstacle, stand still. You will see God&#8217;s hand and power melting your problems, fears, doubts, and all those things that are frustrating you and causing pain and at the same time stopping you from reaching your maximum potential God intended for you. <\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">The second thing God did was &#8220;He told Moses to stretch his rod over the Red Sea, and divide the sea.&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\"> A dry way opened up right before their eyes and they were commanded to walk through it to the other side. Wow! What a miracle! <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">You see, God gave Moses an idea and a plan for overcoming the impossible. He acted on them and they worked. You too need a plan and an idea from God for overcoming. You can thrive on God&#8217;s ideas, thoughts, plans and wisdom. <\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Seek them from His word. You will never overcome successfully on your own, no matter how much you try. If you don&#8217;t want to drown and die, then you must decide to dedicate yourself to God and depend on Him absolutely without if or but, or maybe etc. If you want to sing today and have a happy celebration, then make a decision to go through any of your present or future obstacles with God. <\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Use what you have to make what you need happen. <\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">After the Israelites plowed through their obstacle, they sang a song of praise and worship to God. Praise and worship are inevitable, when facing obstacles, and after victory is won. <\/span><b><\/b><b><i><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">&#8220;Then sang Moses and the children of Israel unto the Lord this song, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously\u2026&#8221; Exodus 15:1<\/span><\/i><\/b> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Read the rest of the song for yourself.<\/span><b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">You really need to read, later on if you can&#8217;t now these two chapters from Bible.<\/span><\/b> <span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">With open heart and willingness to learn, hear from God, and adopt the lessons or strategies revealed, your life will never be the same again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:85%;\">Thanks<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;font-size:85%;\">Evans<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, There are seven strategies or approaches to dealing with obstacles that I would like to share.

When Jesus Christ came into the world, the world would never be the same.  Each individual in the landscape of humanity from that time until now is forced to make a decision concerning the Savior&#8217;s birth.  Ultimately for each person you know, everyone you have met or will meet, and even you yourself are forced to respond to His birth on one side or the other.  One cannot remain neutral about His birth, because to not make a decision for Him is to make a decision against Him.  When Jesus Christ was born into the world He split time in half from BC to AD.  There prophets of old that spoke of His birth would now have their prophetic words fulfilled as Jesus would take His place as prophet, priest and king.  The Magi would bring him gifts symbolizing those OT offices.  The spiritual realm would go into an upheaval at His birth, and not only would the angels respond, but Satan would respond as well (Rev 12:1-9). And of course we looked at the worshippers; again the magi and the shepherds.  To close this series out I would like to take a closer look at the response of the Shepherds, because the shepherds would experience the Divine Child \u2013Shepherd and become a mouthpiece for God to everyone they would speak to.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Perhaps it was a cold night, that night, but the shepherd&#8217;s hearts were warm to believe the angel proclaiming God&#8217;s Word, obey, worship Jesus, and ultimately go and tell all they had seen about the birth of Christ.  Thank God the cold night didn&#8217;t freeze their hearts.  Sadly however, many Christians are cold hearted when it comes to sharing their faith.  They are like the Apostle Peter that  &#8220;\u2026followed Him [Jesus] at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire (Mk. 14:54),&#8221; thawing his cold hands by the warm fire. He said that he would never be ashamed of Jesus. But he was about to deny Him\u2026to a maid. He was about to go through a fiery trial, and three times be found guilty of being ashamed of the one he called his Lord. Peter seated himself in the midst of the ungodly (see Luke 22:55) without any thought for their eternal well-being. He didn&#8217;t want to rock the boat by casting out any nets to be a fisher of men as Jesus taught him, because his fear got in the way (Ray Comfort).  98% of Christians show their cold heart by not sharing their professed faith.  Christianity was never meant to be a private matter, but a publicly proclaimed one.  Only 2% of Christians have hearts warm enough to obey the gospel to tell.  According to 2 Tim 1:7, fear is NOT a valid excuse for us not to share out faith; as a matter of fact God is not hearing ANY excuses of us not sharing our faith.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">How can we laugh, eat next to, and play games with those we love and yet have them leave our presence without knowing about His presence.  If we really believed the gospel then perhaps that was our LAST CHANCE to share the Lord with them and if they die without Christ they will spend eternity in the Lake of Fire separated from Him.  I saw a hit and run recently, whereby one car hit another and drive off.  Death is looking to hit your loved ones and drive them into the Lake of Fire.         <\/span><\/p>\n<p><u><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">Application:<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><span style=\"font-family:Univers 45px Light;font-size:85%;\">  Let&#8217;s take the temperature of your heart and see if you have a cold heart or a warm heart:  This recent Christmas did you share your faith in a purposeful and direct way with you family, friends, and loved ones?  <\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them Luke 2:17-18.&#8221; In this series in way of review, we have looked at how different aspects about responding to the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-855","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-dN","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/855","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=855"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/855\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=855"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=855"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=855"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":854,"date":"2007-12-20T06:30:00","date_gmt":"2007-12-20T14:30:00","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/12\/20\/responding-to-his-birth-part-3-by-pastor-phil\/"},"modified":"2007-12-20T06:30:00","modified_gmt":"2007-12-20T14:30:00","slug":"responding-to-his-birth-part-3-by-pastor-phil","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2007\/12\/20\/responding-to-his-birth-part-3-by-pastor-phil\/","title":{"rendered":"Responding to His birth &#8211; Part 3, by Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Good morning, <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law\u2026\u201d Gal 4:4<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">God\u2019s timing is truly an awesome thing. During this Christmas time, may the story of the birth of Christ never grow old for you, because there is so much that I am realizing lately in the account that we miss. <i><\/i>I pray each of you is reading God\u2019s word daily and therefore these things will bear witness wit your spirit. \u201cWhen the fullness of time was come, God sent forth His son\u2026\u201d God saw fit, that the time had come to NOW send forth Jesus to fulfill the three offices of the Old Testament which are the prophet, the priest, and the King. God brought Jesus into the world to fulfill three offices, which were initially executed by three different persons, by One person, the person of Jesus Christ.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">The prophet was the one that spoke to the people on behalf of God. God would choose someone from among the landscape of His people that he would use as a sound system to bring His word to their ears. The prophet was involved in foretelling (future) and forth telling (current). When Jesus Christ came on the scene He was both the prophet and the Message itself, as the Scripture reads, \u201cAnd the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (Jn 1:14).\u201d There were many prophets through history, but they all died, and therefore God would need to raise a new prophet. But when Jesus came into this world He fulfilled the office as the eternal prophet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Not only did Jesus fulfill the prophetic role, but also the office of priest. The priest spoke to God on behalf of the people. It was the priest that brought the sacrifice to God for the people, so that God could grant forgiveness for the sin of Israel. In Hebrews the author proclaims of Jesus that \u201cCalled of God a high priest for ever after order of Melchisedec. The many former OT priests died as well, \u2018But this man [Jesus] because he continues ever, has an unchangeable priesthood\u2026Who needs not daily, as those high priests to offer sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people\u2019s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself (5:10; 7:24,27).\u201d Jesus didn\u2019t only offer the sacrifice as the priest, but He was the sacrifice once and for all which is why he said, \u201cIt is finished on the cross.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Finally besides fulfilling the office of prophet and priest, he also fulfilled the office of King. Matthew 2 tells us that the wise men (kings) came from the east to Jerusalem to worship \u201cHe that is born King of the Jews.\u201d Jesus&#8217; participation in the Davidic dynasty has already been established by the genealogy, but God would bring a King out of little Bethlehem (see Mic. 5:2, Isa. 9:6, 7). The King had both authority and glory. Paul writes, \u201cNow to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen (1 Tim 1:17).\u201d He was the King and the glory and ultimate authority of the King.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Viewed theologically, however, it may also be said that the time was full because God himself had filled it with meaning. Jesus is the Eternal Prophet, Eternal Priest, and the Eternal King.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Application<\/span><\/u><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">: Because Jesus fulfilled the three offices of priest, prophet and king will you respond to Him in these ways. First confess your sin daily and pray for others, second share your faith regularly, and thirdly worship the King daily in intimacy and adoration.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law\u2026\u201d Gal 4:4 God\u2019s timing is truly an awesome thing.

She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.  Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.  His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born. She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter\u2026  (v. 7) And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down&#8211;that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him. (Rev 12:1 \u2013 8)<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">When one thinks about the Christmas story and the birth of Christ, most go to Luke 1 and Matthew 2 to read about the account. Rarely would one turn to Revelation 12 to read the Christmas story, but this gives us the behind the look at what was taking place in the spiritual realm at the time of Christ\u2019s birth.  As Philip Yancy says, \u201cI have never seen this version of the Christmas story on a Christmas card.  Yet is it the truer story, the rest of the picture of what was going on that fateful night.  Yancy calls the birth of Christ the Great Invasion, \u201ca daring paid by the ruler of the forces of good into the universe\u2019s seat of evil.\u201d  Spiritually speaking, this is no \u201cSilent Night\u201d, It is D-Day!  It\u2019s almost beyond my comprehension altogether, yet it is part of the foundation of my faith.  We live in parallel worlds or realms.  One world is that which we can see of buildings, politicians, moneys, computers, etc\u2026, while the other is a world which most don\u2019t see which consists of angels and demons, and the reality of the spiritual realm.  I say most don\u2019t see because Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, etc\u2026, all saw angels plainly.  Some of us can discern demonic activity, but to see it, is rare.  I have seen into the spiritual realm after an attack on my faith by the Enemy to turn from Jesus and serve him only once. And once was enough.  Needless to say, I submitted to God, called on the name of Jesus, and he fled.\u201d  It was a fierce battle for my soul when I was just a teen, not very strong in the Lord, but the Lord was very strong in His protection over me, because all I knew was to reject the devil and call on Jesus.  Perhaps you have never had something like this happen to you, and maybe never will.

We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him\u2026. they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts (Mt. 2:1-2, 11)\u201d \u201c<u>Herod<\/u> was furious when he learned that the wise men had outwitted him. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys in and around Bethlehem\u2026. (Mt. 2:16).\u201d<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">When we talk about the birth of Jesus, we often hear stories of the angels, shepherds, and wise men that came to worship Him. Different ones had different responses to the birth of the Savoir.  Let\u2019s take a quick peak at each one, and see how you would have responded.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">First, we meet<b><u> the angels<\/u>.<\/b> We know that the angels in heaven cry out for all eternity to each other \u201cHoly, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.\u201d  Angels are created beings and don\u2019t have to submit to God and worship, as Lucifer chose to do.  One third of the angels rebelled in this way, but two-thirds of the angels are still serving their Master.  Heaven rejoiced at the birth of the new born king, and also rejoices over one sinner that repents.  Hence the Savoir came to save sinners, and when He was born into the world to do just that heaven rejoiced, and when Jesus saves another sinner today heaven still rejoices!  <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Secondly,<b><u> the shepherds<\/u><\/b> also responded to the birth of Christ with rejoicing as well.  Shepherds however were the outcasts, the lowly of society, yet God saw fit to bring the outcasts to Christ.  Perhaps God wanted the shepherds to meet the Shepherd of their souls (see Psalm 23 and John 10).  <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Thirdly, there was another group that was lead to the Christ child,<b><u> called the Magi<\/u><\/b>.  These were kings from the east that claimed \u201cwe have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him.\u201d  The magi were the same dream interpreters\/astrologers mentioned for the first time in the book of Daniel.  No wonder God lead the astrologers to Christ via the star, and warned them to return another way through a dream to as to keep His Only Son safe.  The Kings from the east made a far journey and offered their gifts as they worshipped the King of Kings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Lastly, there was one who was both fearful and angry at the birth of the new born King.  Josh McDowell comment, \u201c<b><u>King Herod\u2019s<\/u><\/b> reaction, though, was not one of worship, but one of worry and fear. He was afraid that Jesus, the newborn king, would grow up to overthrow his kingdom, so he did something awful. He had all the boys in Bethlehem murdered. Of course, God did not let Herod win; He protected His Son from Herod\u2019s brutal action so that Jesus could complete His mission as our Savior.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Application<\/span><\/u><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">:  How do you respond to Jesus?

As long as there is nothing to challenge or provoke you, you will feel that you have arrived but the moment something begins to come your way as a reminder that where you are could be a stepping stone, you will purpose in your heart to think twice. Pastor Phil challenges me in the area of witnessing, the Word and discipleship. I have grown more in these areas through his lifestyle, I challenge him in prayers and encouragements because I find myself stronger in these areas.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">In the book of 1Samuel 1:1-28 is an interesting story. We are told of three people, Elkanah, Penninah and Hannah. Elkanah is the husband to both Penninah and Hannah, Elkanah loved Hannah more than Penninah as the bible says. and Elkanah always gave bigger portion of gifts that he had to Hannah and less to Penninah. Penninah on the other hand was blessed with children because God opened her womb. Hannah&#8217;s womb was shut. In the Old testament  having children especially boys was a sign of a blessing, a man was considered blessed if his wife could give him boys. Well we see how Elkanah loved Hannah more than Penninah and yet Hannah had no children. If you remember, Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and yet Leah had many children while Rachel did not until at a later time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">One thing about the story of Hannah that fascinates me is that she was okay until Penninah had children and she desired her own, to make matters worse in 1samuel 1<b> vs.  6 &#8220;\u2026 her rival (Penninah) also provoked her severely, to make her miserable&#8221;.<\/b> Yes Hannah was loved more than Penninah, and yes she received more gifts than her but yet she realized there was more she could have desired. Her desire was not to compete against her rival or get even, her desire was to gain more from the Lord. God had allowed Penninah to provoke her as Leah was allowed to provoke Rachel. She decides to go to pray to God, a prayer of desperation, praying earnestly and constantly the only thing that made her prayers to be  answered is when she vowed that the child God would give her, she would dedicate him back to God serving Him all the days of his life. Samuel is born,  became a prophet and what a mighty man he was. Also, Rachel bore Joseph who later became the number two man in Egypt and through his life, Israel was saved from a severe draught. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Suppose there was nothing to challenge and provoke these women to move to the next level, what an opportunity many would have missed. \u201c<b>All things work together<\/b>\u201d whether it be frustrations, someone provoking you, or through what you see and get challenged by. I would pray that we will evaluate and examine the reason why we would desire more than what we have. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">I thank God for this far He has brought me but with the new things that are provoking and challenging me, I am going after them.

We are told of three people, Elkanah, Penninah and Hannah. Elkanah is the husband to both Penninah and Hannah, Elkanah loved Hannah more than Penninah as the bible says. and Elkanah always gave bigger portion of gifts that he had to Hannah and less to Penninah. Penninah on the other hand was blessed with children because God opened her womb. Hannah&#8217;s womb was shut. In the Old testament  having children especially boys was a sign of a blessing, a man was considered blessed if his wife could give him boys. Well we see how Elkanah loved Hannah more than Penninah and yet Hannah had no children. If you remember, Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah and yet Leah had many children while Rachel did not until at a later time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">One thing about the story of Hannah that fascinates me is that she was okay until Penninah had children and she desired her own, to make matters worse in 1samuel 1<b> vs.  6 &#8220;\u2026 her rival (Penninah) also provoked her severely, to make her miserable&#8221;.<\/b> Yes Hannah was loved more than Penninah, and yes she received more gifts than her but yet she realized there was more she could have desired. Her desire was not to compete against her rival or get even, her desire was to gain more from the Lord. God had allowed Penninah to provoke her as Leah was allowed to provoke Rachel. She decides to go to pray to God, a prayer of desperation, praying earnestly and constantly the only thing that made her prayers to be  answered is when she vowed that the child God would give her, she would dedicate him back to God serving Him all the days of his life. Samuel is born,  became a prophet and what a mighty man he was. Also, Rachel bore Joseph who later became the number two man in Egypt and through his life, Israel was saved from a severe draught. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Suppose there was nothing to challenge and provoke these women to move to the next level, what an opportunity many would have missed. \u201c<b>All things work together<\/b>\u201d whether it be frustrations, someone provoking you, or through what you see and get challenged by.

If you have goals, you work hard to achieve them and many times within the time frame you have allocated those goals. Often times you find that in pursuit of your goal, there are some things that occur that creates a setback or a delay in what you are working hard towards. The setbacks can be painful and costly but they are there and have to be dealt with. Setbacks will not push you forward but backwards if not stagnant and this could take days, weeks, months and even years. Do we ever sit and wonder why at times we have setbacks in our lives?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">John 15 is a good chapter that paints the picture of how setbacks work. Jesus likened Himself to a True vine and the Father as the vinedresser. As believers we are connected to the True vine as branches and the branches have significant roles of bearing fruit. Jesus says,<b> &#8220;Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away<\/b>&#8220;. Note how He puts it, &#8220;every branch IN ME&#8221;, in other words, every believer connected to Him should bear fruit and there has to be things within that believer that allows them to stay connected and be fresh to bear fruit. The branches that do not bear fruit are dead branches He takes away because they do not belong to Him. No one can take them away but Him. It is my hope that we do not fall into this category.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">&#8220;<b>and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit<\/b>&#8220;. This is where many of us are, it&#8217;s not that the branch is not bearing fruit, the reason for the setback. And it&#8217;s not always sin that sets us back, at times it&#8217;s because God wants us to bear more fruit. So He may take away a good thing that is happening in your life and of course that would create a setback but He knows what He is doing. We know the devil loves to whisper in our ears the reason we are going through what we are facing is because we messed up. When David was anointed to be king, for the next 17 years he was running for his life not because he sinned but because He was being pruned to bear more fruit and so was Job, Daniel and many others in the bible. It was not even to teach them a lesson, it was to get them to bear more fruit. The pruning the Lord does is to allow His children to grow and be stronger. You may have seen yourself being married by now and nothing has happened and you wonder whether you sinned or missed God&#8217;s will or you are being taught a lesson and the like.<b> The blessing may be delayed but not denied<\/b>. It could be the Lord wants to develop more of the fruit of patience, faith, self-control among others. You may have worked hard to get a job and you did but then you lost it and it created a setback, you never know, maybe the Lord is developing in you character and integrity that will sustain you when he opens the door. You may have desired to be in ministry and nothing has happened yet, could be the Lord is teaching you leadership, submission, humility and more. I&#8217;m not saying you may have not had them, he says<b> &#8220;that it may bear more fruit<\/b>&#8220;, He wants to get more of it out of you. This could also be the grounds of testimonies that despite all that has happened, God knew what He was doing and in His right time, He made all things beautiful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">You and I can look at the setbacks as TEMPORARY situations that delay what we want to achieve<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">. It&#8217;s upon us to look at them as some things the Lord could be using to get more fruit out of us. We can also look at them as a means of growth. Instead of crying to the Lord asking why we have them, we can pray Lord what can I learn from this. Over the years I have seen setbacks in my life help me grow and I thank God for them.

I pray that this will word will revolutionize you prayer life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">For things to move, change and function, they need some kind of energy or force. The cars need the motor and battery for it to function, the light need the power to make it shine, the pcs need the software for them to function. You and I realize that some things don&#8217;t move or change until some force or energy is applied to them. This goes well with our spiritual life, there is absolutely nothing that will cause us to change or move until some force or energy is ignited in our system to cause us to desire change, move and operate effectively. How will you have it if you don&#8217;t feel that you need it? and how will you need it without knowing it&#8217;s effectiveness?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Jesus is making a triumphant entry into Jerusalem, He is riding on a donkey and people are crying out hosanna, hosanna in the Highest, blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord. He is heading towards the temple. If I had time, I would talk about what the donkey represents, people bowing, placing their garments on the ground but that is for another time.  I want to concentrate on what He did when He got to the temple.<b> Mathew 21:12, &#8220;Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple&#8230;&#8221;. The first thing He did in the temple was cleanse it<\/b>. This bring us to<b> 1Corinthians 3:16, &#8220;Know ye not that you are the temple of the living God, and the spirit of God dwells in you?&#8221;.<\/b> First of all, Jesus said that He will destroy the temple and build it in three days to which He was referring to Himself, then Paul comes a long and reminds us that we are the temple of the living God. So when Christ was coming into the physical temple to cleanse it, He is coming to our spiritual temple to cleanse it. He has to rearrange, remove corruption and remind us of the main priority of the temple. Let&#8217;s look at three &#8220;Ps&#8221; in this text.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Mathew 21:13, &#8220;And He said to them, &#8220;It is written, &#8220;<u>My house shall be called a house of prayer<\/u>&#8220;.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> The first P is for<b><u> PRAYER<\/u><\/b>. He defined the house by calling it a house of prayer, I have no doubt that He has called my heart a heart of prayer. I&#8217;m not talking about the prayer of God bless this meal, I&#8217;m talking about effective prayers, the process of being connected to a heavenly circuit. Many are not progressing for they have power cables but they are doing nothing with them.  The circuits are there only waiting for you to plug in your power cables. I don&#8217;t think you can progress without knowing that you have cables, know where to plug them in and how to plug them in. Prayer becomes your power cables. What are you doing with them?<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Mathew 21:14, &#8220;The blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">&#8220;. Hooking your cables through prayer causes you to encounter with number 2 &#8220;P&#8221; for<b><u> POWER<\/u><\/b>. Prayer produces power when it&#8217;s connected right because as the scriptures says, first He cleansed the house, then He declared His house to be a house of prayer, then prayer produced the power to heal the blind and the lame in the temple. If you do not know what prayer does, there is no way you will pray. Prayers are like an energy that has force to  get things moving, changing and transforming. In this case it has produced power to do exploits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Mathew 21:15, &#8220;&#8230;the children crying out in the temple and saying, &#8220;Hosanna to the Son of David!&#8221;, &#8230;, vs. 16, &#8230; And Jesus said to them, .. Have you not read, &#8220;Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants,<u> You have perfected praise&#8221;<\/u><\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">. The number 3 &#8220;P&#8221; is for<b><u> PRAISE<\/u><\/b>. Believe me when I say that power produces praise. Someone might say, suppose you pray and it did not happen, how will that produce praise? when I have prayed and it has produced power, that power will produce praise to believe God that even though He has not done it or done it yet, I still know He can do it, I know that He is able and I know it&#8217;s not about me but about Him so I praise Him any way. The three &#8220;Ps&#8221; have helped me grow in my prayer life to understand that PRAYER produces POWER, and power produces PRAISE. As I have said in the past, prayer is the vehicle God uses to get things done. Confess that you are a house of prayer and then live as a house of prayer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Mathew 21:13-17, &#8220;And He said to them, &#8220;It is written, &#8220;My house shall be called a house of prayer&#8220; Due to a lot of commitments yesterday, I was unable to deliver the devo, be blessed this morning.

And there is none upon the earth that I desire besides You.<u> My flesh and my heart fail; But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever&#8221;<\/u><\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">There are times when you know what you should do but you are not doing them. You have the skills, you have the ability but the strength to make it happen is what is lacking. We know of the phrase from the bible,<b> Mark 14:38 &#8220;&#8230;The Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak<\/b>&#8220;. The Spirit desires to win but for the winning to really take place, the Spirit has to get the flesh on the same page otherwise both will war against each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Have you been feeling so tired of late dragging your feet to do anything? Waking up is a struggle, praying is a struggle, so is reading the word. The Spirit is really willing but the flesh is just too weak to agree with the Spirit. There is war in the body and that war has to be overcome. I&#8217;m not even talking about sinning but having no strength to do what you and I should do to be even stronger. I need strength to move from point A to point B, I need to stay focused, I need to concur even more but I don&#8217;t have that strength. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">The bible tells us of who we have in heaven, our heavenly Father, there is no doubt about that. The second thing is that who do we desire besides Him? This is a way to set priorities right for everything that we need revolves around our heavenly Father. He is the author of good things.<b> Desire to seek His kingdom first channels other desires to be fulfilled for they are desires revolving around Him<\/b>. The truth of the matter is that flesh will fail and so is the heart. I am yet to meet someone whose flesh and heart never fails. Flesh could fail in trials and temptations, heart could fail in the area of faith but the bible states it clearly,<b> God is the strength of my heart<\/b>. Why not, God is the strength of my flesh? God deals with the heart, if we allow Him get to the heart; the heart has a way of affecting the flesh to comply with the Spirit. Like mentioned, the Spirit (heart) is indeed willing, ready, expecting but what makes it fail is the flesh.<b><u> Strength is the fuel that helps each of us accomplish what needs to be done<\/u><\/b>. You can have vision, dreams, ambitions, and abilities but God strengthens us to bring those things to a completion. It&#8217;s just like you can make a body and it may look good and strong but without the breath of God, the body will do nothing. God&#8217;s strength is our breath, pumping the heart to keep beating and give life to the entire being.<b> Philippians 4:13, &#8220;I can do all things through Christ who<u> strengthens<\/u> me&#8221;,<\/b> you can endure all things because the heart has been given strength<b>. Isaiah 26:4, &#8220;Trust in the Lord forever, For in Yah, the Lord is everlasting<u> strength<\/u>&#8220;, 2Corinthians 12:9, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, my<u> strength<\/u> is made perfect in weakness&#8221;, Psalm 46:1, &#8220;God is my refuge and<u> strength<\/u>&#8230;&#8221;<\/b>. God has deposited many wonderful things in our lives; we now need His strength to make them happen. Let me also say that<b><u> God&#8217;s strength is the heartbeat of our Christian living<\/u><\/b>. Through His strength we can say no to sin, strength to worship Him, strength to reach out to others, strength to bring forth more spiritual babies.

If you talk to different people, they will tell you of the people they look up to, people who give them a reason to pursue something bigger than them. People that gave them a reason to pursue what they never believed could ever happen. Joshua had a spiritual leader Moses, so was Elisha who had Elijah, Paul who had a Timothy to mention a few.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">In his writing to the Corinthians, Paul opens with this line in chapter 11:1, &#8220;<b>Be ye followers (imitators) of me, even as I also am of Christ&#8221;.<\/b> Why did he not say &#8220;<b>follow Christ as I follow Him<\/b>&#8220;, because Paul knew to follow Christ meant laying it all on the line. He had learnt to pick up his cross and follow Christ daily. He had been a living example to many who might have not thought it possible to lay it all on the line and be like Christ. In<b> Philippians 3:8<\/b>, he says, &#8220;<b>Yet indeed I also count all things loss<u> for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus<\/u> my Lord, for whom<u> I have suffered the loss of all things<\/u>, and count them as rubbish<u>, that I may gain Christ<\/u>&#8220;.<\/b> By the standards of the world before his conversion, Paul had it all, meeting Christ on his way to Damascus to persecute Christians altered and changed his life forever. He had not walked with Christ physically like the other disciple but to imitate Christ, he was going to have a taste of what it means to walk with Him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Paul&#8217;s life was not an easy road, having been stoned and left to die, survived shipwreck, had been beaten, had been jailed, rejected yet in all this he was fulfilled because if Christ did not have it easy in this world and still accomplished his mission,<b><u> Paul being a bond servant of the Lord saw himself finishing his mission through Christ who he imitated and gave him strength<\/u><\/b> (Philippians 4:13). Something about Christ propelled Paul to ride out what had made many men give up. Something about Christ fascinated him that he tells us of his desire in<b> Philippians 3:10, that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death&#8221;.<\/b> You would think that Paul desiring to imitate Christ was for him to be successful in this life, have a lot of money, have respect and be happy. It turns out that his desire was to operate in the power that resurrected Christ<b> 1 Corinthians 2:4, &#8220;And my speech and my preaching were not with persuasive words of human wisdom,<u> but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power<\/u><\/b>&#8220;, &#8220;<b>And the fellowship of his suffering<\/b>&#8220;, Paul had a taste of what it meant to suffer for Christ.<b> &#8220;Being conformed to His death<\/b>&#8220;. As Christ died for the purpose of redeeming sinners, so Paul had that same purpose in a lesser sense; he lived and would willingly die to reach sinners with the gospel. His life and death, though not redemptive, were for the same purpose as his Lord&#8217;s. In imitating Christ, Paul made himself of no reputation, he was a bondservant, humbled and was willing to suffer for Christ. I believe with all my heart that in his hard times, he would have not cried, &#8220;<b>Jesus bring me OUT of this<\/b>&#8221; his prayer would have been, &#8220;<b>Jesus bring me THROUGH this<\/b>&#8220;. For me<b><u> to bring out is to escape, but to bring through is to endure<\/u><\/b>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">By saying, &#8220;<b>be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ<\/b>&#8221; Paul is not suggesting to us that he counted himself something; he is teaching us what it means to follow Christ because he was a living proof.  He was also glad that the Corinthians had received his teachings but he wanted to make it clear that He was not the head, that he was not making it by his own strength or his own teachings. This is why he pointed them back to his reason for being who he was. He tells them in vs. 3,<b> But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ,..<\/b><\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Tahoma;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">&#8220;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Our spiritual leaders ought to point us back to the head; Christ and their lives should be an imitation of Christ in everyway and if that&#8217;s not the case, then one should change the course. Their lives ought to be an example to us that despite how tough it is to pick up the cross and follow Christ, if they are making it through Christ who strengthens them, we too can through Christ who strengthens us. If we have other people who look up to us as spiritual leaders then like Paul let us strive to imitate Christ in every aspect of our lives. Paul had a desire to imitate Christ and also NOT fail Christ by leading the followers of Jesus a stray.

You know for sure how much good you want to do and out of nowhere, this evil side of you shows up with an aim to over power you. And it becomes easy for you or other people to concentrate on the evil side than the good side. One little evil thing can ruin your reputation. We see this on TV, regardless of how many good things one has done; one negative thing contrary to one&#8217;s life style spoils everything. Now they become the talk of the town, press reports don&#8217;t portray the other good side of you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Suppose you are in a communion service and the pastor says, &#8220;Before we have communion, if you have any faults with anyone, please walk over to them and confess it&#8221; and here you are closing your eyes thinking, &#8220;I bet when I open my eyes, there will be tons of people lining up to confess how they feel about me&#8221;, a brother comes to me and says, &#8220;Evans, for many months I always thought you were a rotten, self centered, arrogant person, please forgive me&#8221;. At that point he would have fixed his problem and I will have a problem with him for thinking of me that way. What can I say, man operates in this level that regardless of how many good things you have done, one small evil is enough to jeopardize everything depending on how we deal with it. What people see as our weakness is what kills us but that&#8217;s not necessarily the case for many times we get killed by our own guilt and shame. Your conscious tells you that you are wrong, a deep conviction comes within and now you have something to worry about and deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">With that in mind and knowing that we are humans, we all have faults in our lives? battling with anger, lust, frustrations, fear, doubt, compromise, anxiety, pride to mention but a few, you try very hard to deal with it, you even confess it but before long you are back to it again. You cry about being free and days you feel like you have overcome it but before long, you are back to the same thing. Been there, and still struggle with it. The message this morning is very simple and straight to the point,<b> Romans 12:21, &#8220;Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good&#8221;,<\/b> let no evil be the one to control you but let the good in you deposited by Christ chock out the evil in you. Look at your greatest strengths, the things in your life you are proud of, the things that people admire about in your life and begin to cultivate on those good things. Anytime you are overwhelmed by your evil side, don&#8217;t sit down and hold a pity party or go into depression, look at your strengths, pump life into your strengths and you will be amazed at how your strengths begin to chock out your weaknesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">I have spent so much time trying to fix the bad that, I neglected the good God had deposited in me.  In the bible we see so many people who had faults but the bible talks more about their strengths than their weaknesses. Though Moses sinned by disobeying the Lord, the legacy he left behind was that he was a friend of God. David is even worse, for David was weak sexually. We saw him commit adultery with Bathsheba, yet with all David&#8217;s weaknesses and failures he was known as a man after God&#8217;s own heart. He did not allow his weakness to put him down, he knew of his strengths for he was a worshipper, a man who will not do anything without checking with the Lord. He strengthened his confidence and trust in the Lord. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Taking something out of your life means that there will be a void somewhere within you and without replacing the old with something new, guess what? The old thing will come back and occupy the old spot (I am talking in terms of lets say a bad habit that you want to get rid of). Overcoming evil with good is also desiring by the help of God to deal with something and having something good in mind to replace it with. We give God the glory for He is ready to help us if we are ready to change<b> 2Thessalonians 3:3, &#8220;But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil&#8221;, Jude 1:24, &#8220;Now unto Him who is able to keep you from falling, and present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy&#8221;.<\/b> I&#8217;m so glad that the Lord is able to keep me from doing evil and then present me faultless and spotless in the presence of His glory with exceeding joy. I want to reach and say though I had my own weakness, I overcame my weakness by working and doing good. Sinning is not good and the Lord hates it<b> Proverbs 8:13, &#8220;The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride and arrogance, and the evil way and the forward mouth, do I hate&#8221;.<\/b> As we work more on fearing the Lord which is doing His will, which is in line with His law, we will begin to hate evil and overcome it. Stop dwelling so much on your weaknesses and start working more on your strengths. A phrase that I like (I cannot remember who wrote it or said it) states, if you are going to love, love faithfully: if you are going to win, win gracefully: if you are going to learn, learn by teaching, and<b><u> if you are going to fall, fall reaching<\/u>.<\/b> Change how you deal with your weaknesses!!!!<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Have a blessed weekend <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 12:21, &#8220;Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good&#8221; There is a continuous struggle between the good we want to do and the evil that surfaces.

Immediately they went into hiding because they were naked and a shamed of what they did.

Adam blamed his wife, his wife blamed the serpent.

People even blame God today for their mistakes saying &#8220;it&#8217;s God&#8217;s fault, He made me like this&#8221;.

God had to slay the animals and shed their blood. The Lord furnished the skins, fashioned the garments, and clothed Adam and Eve. God did it all; they did nothing. After divine condemnation and judgment for this first sin, God acted in mercy to provide a way of salvation, and He demonstrated His grace to cover the shame of man. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Romans 4:7, &#8220;Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven,<u> And whose sins are covered<\/u>;&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> This does not mean God over looks our sins and neither did he overlook Adam and Eve&#8217;s sin by covering it up, this is God taking that which is naked and shameful and clothes it with Christ&#8217;s&#8217; Righteousness.

To put on the Lord Jesus also is to put on humility. We try to find ways to be worthy by trying to cover ourselves with the leaves of self righteousness but those leaves need to come down so that the God of grace and mercy can provide us with garments. The prodigal son in Luke 15 having been lost and found his way back home received a different treatment from what he had expected. The bible says,<b> Vs 20 And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. 21 And the son said to him, &#8216;Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.&#8217; 22 &#8220;<u>But the father said to his servants, &#8216;Bring out the BEST ROBE (GARMENT) and PUT IT ON HIM<\/u>, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.<\/b> He uncovered himself by taking off the leaves by admitting his sin and his father demonstrated his love and compassion by putting on him the best robe. Notice that the prodigal son did not blame his age, the country he went to, what he got involved in, or what had happened to Him. He took responsibility for what he had done and cried for mercy.<b> Proverbs 28:13<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">He who covers his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.&#8221; We praise God for clothing us in spite of it all<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <span class=\"867190302-07122007\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;color:#0000ff;\"><br \/><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 3:21, &#8220;\ufeff21\ufeff And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them,&#8221; (TRSV).Adam and Eve disobeyed God, Eve was deceived and Adam listened to his wife and disobeyed God.

As I have said before, in general we human beings are selfish beings. We come for us, we come to receive and if we don&#8217;t get it as expected, frustrations crops in. Some have been so much affected that they left because they were not satisfied by the service they received. Do we ever stop and say, &#8220;<b>What can I do as a form of service?&#8221;<\/b> in other words, I have always come to receive, it is time for me to now give. No one teaches what service and giving is all about like Jesus,<b> John 13:4, &#8220;rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. After that, He poured water into a basin and<u> began to wash the disciples&#8217; feet<\/u>, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded&#8221;.<\/b> The King of kings laid aside His Kingship garments (robe) and guarded Himself with a towel to serve those who considered Him their Teacher and Master. It&#8217;s easy to wash someone&#8217;s hair, they do it many times but washing someone&#8217;s feet? I mean going down on your knees to wash dusty, may be smelling feet? You have to be humbled to do that. Some would do it for money, Jesus was doing it out of love. Check out &#8220;fear factor&#8221; on TV and see what people would do for money. They risk their lives, doing weird things just to get money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">We love the phrase, son, daughter, royal priesthood, because it makes us feel important but to be called a servant sounds like an insult. Degrading position in human eyes yet we are called servants by God. Look at how God calls these men<b> Genesis 26:24, &#8220;&#8230;I will bless you and multiply your descendants for<u> My servant<\/u> Abraham&#8217;s sake.&#8221;, Numbers 12:7, &#8220;Not so with<u> My servant<\/u> Moses; He is faithful in all My house&#8221;<\/b>.<b> Numbers 14:24, &#8220;But<u> My servant<\/u> Caleb, because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me fully<\/b>&#8220;,<b> 2 Samuel 7:5, &#8220;Go and tell<u> My servant<\/u> David<\/b>&#8220;. What is so common about these four men, they were<b> great leaders yet they humbled themselves as servants and they served faithfully<\/b>. God does not call them great, big, mighty names, He calls them MY SERVANTS. They served people yet they were doing it for the Lord. What did Jesus say to the disciples who were disputing on who is the greatest in the kingdom,<b> Mark 9:35, &#8220;And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, &#8220;If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and<u> servant of all.&#8221; It&#8217;s not about titles, it&#8217;s about service<\/u><\/b>. It&#8217;s about seeing what you can do for the Lord and rolling your sleeves to do it faithfully without complaining. Many pastor\u2019s today want to lead like CEO\u2019s rather than lead like a shepherd; a servant God has called them to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">God says in Leviticus 25:55, &#8220;For the children of Israel are<u> servants to Me&#8230;&#8221;,<\/u><\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> called for to fulfill tasks granted by God. Called to work and fight but under the guidance and supervision of the Lord. When they were told about a land flowing with milk and honey, maybe they thought they would just walk in and take it not knowing that there was work involved, (stooping down as a servants and working hard to get to that destination). See the flesh does not like the idea of stooping low and serving. This is the reason why I cannot pray, &#8220;LET ME BE A SERVANT&#8221;, I pray  &#8220;MAKE ME (mold me) A SERVANT\u201d. After all, what will the rest of the people think about us if we call ourselves servants? I don&#8217;t care about titles and positions, I would rather have the titles and positions define the office I am serving in and not what I am. All I care about is serving at any capacity because He has made me a servant. On that day I will not be introduced as thy good and faithful preacher, I will be introduced as<b> Matthew 25:2, &#8220;\u2026, &#8220;Well done, good and<u> faithful servant<\/u>&#8220;.<\/b> Are you a servant at your job, in church, in your community?

It talks about the shield of faith, the breastplate of righteousness, the helmet of salvation, the sword of the spirit. The word \u201cfeet\u201d is not there just to fill in, it has a significant meaning. Feet help you relocate, it makes you move, it makes you go. When Jesus said, &#8220;<b>Go ye into the world and preach the gospel<\/b>&#8220;. The beginning word \u201cGO\u201d requires \u201cFEET\u201d that would mean on your prayers, put feet to it and go. I do not see anywhere in the scripture where it says \u201c<b>how lovely are the feet of those who sit<\/b>&#8220;. You would imagine that those who sit have lovely feet because they are clean but the bible talks about those who go as the ones with lovely feet. Their feet may be full of dust, dragging, weary from walking, but they are still going because it&#8217;s the message that they have that makes their feet lovely. As I go out witnessing, I always have enough excuses as to why I should not go. When I go and it\u2019s done, I come back rejoicing. Going up the mountain is tough and so is going after sinners but coming from the mountain is easy and relaxing and so is after witnessing, you come back rejoicing and relaxed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Think of it this way, at a police station, they have a party and everyone has been invited including those who have broken the laws, they have a DJ, good food, gifts etc, tell me, how many would still show up at the party? very few. So is with the church, we are hoping that sinners will find their way to the church, we promise good music, spiritual food, a place of peace but still very few come. Why? because a guilty person will find it hard and intimidating showing up at a police station, we have to go out and apprehend them.<b> Romans 10:14&amp;15, &#8220;How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe on Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? vs. 15, &#8220;<u>And shall they preach unless they are sent<\/u>?.<\/b> Vs. 15 has been fulfilled when Jesus said, &#8220;go ye&#8221;, we are the preachers who will preach to them repentance and faith, the only two keys to salvation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Here is what makes the feet of him that goes lovely,<b> Psalm 119:105, &#8220;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path&#8221;.<\/b> Jesus Christ is the divine light, His words we preach is the lamp to our feet that causes us to have lovely feet and He lights our path towards sinners. \u201cThe lamp unto the feet\u201d is for those who are moving<b><u>.

FOR IT IS WRITTEN, &#8216;You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.'&#8221; Hebrews 10:7, &#8220;Then I said, &#8216;Behold, I have come-In the volume of the book it is written of Me-To do Your will, O God.'&#8221; <\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">A police officer can only exercise authority because he has a badge that gives him that authority. As a Christian, we have the authority of the scripture to speak what it says rather than our own opinions and beliefs. Today people want to live by their own created beliefs, assumptions, ideas and the like. And the question that tends to run into my mind is, <strong>&#8220;by whose authority do you speak of these things?&#8221;<\/strong> Satan came to tempt Jesus in the wilderness and Jesus took the authority of the scripture, quoted it and stood by it. He told Satan, &#8220;It is written&#8230;&#8221;. The written word of God gives us the authority to speak it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Many have a problem believing the story of Jonah and the whale, Jesus had no problem believing it because it was true and He was there when it happened, He quoted it <strong>Matthew 12:40, &#8221; For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth&#8221;.<\/strong> In as much as we have our own ideas and thoughts of how things should be or should be dealt with, the Holy Scripture ought to be our final authority. And we can not pick and choose what we want to believe and agree with. We cannot also go around trying to find loop holes in the bible to support what we want to justify or smash our thinking as to what we believe the author meant. If I&#8217;m looking at a painting, my interpretation of the painting has no authority over what the painter meant for it to be when he painted it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">The Bible has been banned, burned, and, to some, supposedly &#8220;debunked,&#8221; yet still its truth stands. It remains the test of orthodoxy for all who claim to be of God or speak of God&#8217;s ways. <strong>2 Tim 3:16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,&#8221;<\/strong> The most important thing about Scripture is not just that we read it or study it, but that we live it, that we obey the Lord (James 1:22). <strong><u>God did not give us His Word merely to inform us, but to change our lives<\/u><\/strong> therefore we receive it as it is even when we find certain verses hard to accept and follow. . As Mark Twain aptly put it, <strong>&#8220;it is not the things in the Bible that people can&#8217;t understand that prove troublesome, but the things they can understand. Even if people are convinced that the Bible is true from cover to cover, will they heed its message?&#8221;<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Today the Bible&#8217;s credibility and authority are still attacked. Yet how many of its critics have carefully studied its teaching? How many have even looked at the story of how it came to be written? A careful reader will recognize that the Bible is not so much a single book as a library of sixty-six books. It contains a variety of literary genres: history, poetry, narrative, exposition, parable, and &#8220;apocalyptic&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">The writers in the bible though different unified their stories, they offer the same understanding of God throughout. He is one God, Creator, Savior, and Judge. He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and eternal. His character is holy, good, loving, and just. They tell us of the human nature. People are made in God&#8217;s image and are capable of great good. Yet they are also sinful rendering man helpless under the weight of sin and only God made away of escape through His Son Jesus. They offer a common understanding of Jesus Christ. He is both God and man. He became a real human being in order to show the world the God it could not otherwise perceive. Something deeply significant happened as a result of His death on the cross, making it possible for God and humanity to be reconciled. They offer the same hope. God will accomplish His purposes for His creation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><strong>Hebrews 10:7, &#8220;Then I said, &#8216;Behold, I have come-In the volume of the book it is written of Me-To do Your will, O God.&#8217;<\/strong> Jesus came in the volume written of Him, quoted it as the truth because He is truth, the same reason the scripture should be our final authority.

We are always attracted to the best and we desire the best in every aspect but at the same time we are reminded that good things never come easily, one has to work for them, has to for go certain things to be able to attain them. We also know that easy come most of the time becomes easy go, for what one has not sweated for can be replaced by something new. When you know that you gave up on certain things, or suffered to gain certain things you will cherish, nature and protect what you have gained at all cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">We are also the type of beings who want to receive what we dish out. If we treat nicely, we expect the same to come back to us, if we love we want to be loved back and this often needs to take place more less at the same time meaning that if I become nice to you, in the next few minutes, hours, days I would expect the same from you.<b> Acts 10:38, &#8220;how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him&#8221;<\/b>. Jesus was anointed to do good without expecting the good to come back to Him. He knew of every thought, He knew everyone in and out and yet He still went about doing good. He was preparing His ground and sowing seeds knowing that they would not spring the next day or the next month as there would be a time when He would reap all that He sowed.<b> John 12:24, &#8220;Unless the grain of wheat falls on the ground and dies, it abides alone but if it dies, it shall be able to bare much fruit&#8221;.<\/b> He was sowing Himself as the seed that eventually He would bare more fruit. He was set for us an example that we may sow ourselves as good seeds to others.  Sowing ourselves as seeds to others, work, home would also cause us to die to self.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Vs. 9, &#8220;And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart&#8221;.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> How easy it is to be good to people who are good to us but the Lord is asking us to also be good to people who are not nice to us. We deal with different characters every day and at times you wish you would reach out and do something stupid but I have discovered that you can never fight fire with fire, if one starts with fire you better come with the goodness as the fire extinguisher as you will be amazed at how it works. Doing good I believe has no conditions but doing it whole heartedly for it&#8217;s not upon us to reap it from the same people but maybe different people. Doing good is not a seasonal thing but a continues thing regardless of the time.<b> Vs. 10, &#8220;therefore we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith&#8221;.<\/b> This line is very true especially in our jobs, we have been given an opportunity by God to be good to our colleagues who might at times drive us crazy, customers who can be insensitive at times and the like for, we ought to shine every where we go.<b> Math 5:16, &#8220;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works (goodness) and glorify your Father in heaven&#8221;.<\/b> <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Phil 2:14-15, &#8220;Do all things without murmuring and complaining, that you maybe blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">. Being good to people who don&#8217;t deserve it helps us believers maintain our precious seed that will not be corrupted by someone else actions but at the same time, we are also instructed to do things without murmuring and complaining. Jesus did everything without complaining and reading Phil 2 shows what He reaped in the end. Our theme verse today is,<b> &#8220;Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap&#8221;,<\/b> God is seeing everything that we do and hears what we say. Whatever seeds we plant, at one point we will reap it. If you sow kindness, if not now, one day you will reap it if you don&#8217;t get weary in sowing it. If you sow hard work, if not now, one day you will reap it for God has stated reaped that He cannot be mocked in other words He cannot be fooled. He has all the records of our deeds<b> Rev 22:12, &#8220;Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be&#8221;.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Let&#8217;s sow every good seed we can find (peace, joy, respect, help, good workers etc) without expecting a return and let&#8217;s count Him faithful that has promised. You may not see the return now and it may not come from the people you expect it to come from and you may not be appreciated for the hard work you are doing and you might not even be recognized for the efforts made and you may deal with arrogant people, the key thing is to sow goodness at all times for it&#8217;s the Lord who rewards not men.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Galatians 6:6-10, &#8220;Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap&#8221; As human beings we are drawn to good things and we do respond to good things.

Man fails God everyday by doing things not in line with His word. Man snatch things given to them and fail to give honor and thanks to the giver. How could He care for a bunch of complainers? He owes us nothing yet He still reaches out to us. He has blessed us so much but we are more concerned about what we have asked Him and has not done them yet. We want the good things He does for us but we don&#8217;t want to live for Him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">There is nothing that humbles me like people&#8217;s lives, though we don&#8217;t see many sick people out here, hospitals will paint a different picture. There are people going without food, don&#8217;t have a place to live, desire to be free to do things differently, have to walk to work, get paid less but don&#8217;t complain, have no bank account or if had, there is either nothing in it or less in it, don&#8217;t have friends or families. I don&#8217;t know whether you are getting the picture I am trying paint. God has blessed us far beyond what we could ever imagine or think and yet we are not qualified for them, we are not even better than those people who have something missing in their lives. Many have lost their lives through accidents but you and I have survived things that destroyed others. Some people who have things we feel like are missing in their lives yet they look comfortable and joyous. &#8220;Lord, what is man, that You take knowledge of Him? I wonder why God would be mindful of me when I know I am nothing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Amazing because often we don&#8217;t stop to think about how the Lord has taken knowledge of us. We don&#8217;t stop and think how our lives would be without Him being involved. Even with that we fail to give Him Honor for who He is and what He has done in our lives. How often do you take time to thank God for your salvation, His Word, the air you breath, good health, freedom, food, shelter, family, friends etc . How about you prayed or asked people to pray for you and He did exactly what you prayed for? Honoring Him would mean, &#8220;Lord, You have done so much in my life, what do you require of me? what can I do apart from thanking You to show my appreciation for what You have done in my life&#8221;. We snatch things He has given us like spoiled brats and we disappear in the thin air until we are need again then we resurface. In Luke 17, there were ten lepers who upon seeing Jesus asked Him to have mercy upon them and heal them of their leprosy. Jesus having compassion on them directed them to go and show themselves to the priest and as they were going, they received their healing. Watch this, Luke 17:15&amp;16, &#8220;And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified, and fell down on his face at His feet, giving Him thanks&#8221; Out of the ten, only one came back to give thanks, the rest snatched the healing and disappeared. Jesus got concerned about the other nine who received the same healing and did not come to give thanks. We can fail to give thanks because we think we deserved or earned the blessing. If we took time to pray for something and we received it, we need to take time to thank the Giver and desire to know what He requires of us. I don&#8217;t want to take the blessings God brings into my life for granted for it could have been me on the streets begging, it could have been me sick, it could have been me failing but He is mindful of me, Job 7:17, &#8220;What is man, that You should magnify him?&#8221;, He has made me bigger than what I was by myself, Job 15:14, &#8220;What is man, that he should be clean?&#8221;, I couldn&#8217;t make myself clean, Psalm 8:4, &#8220;What is man, that You are mindful of him? the son of man, that You visit him?. Because He cares so much for us, He has blessed us, what are we going to do? Lord, thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You for all You have done, for what You are doing and for what You will do. Have a thankful day, this week of thanksgiving.

When the bible talks about the Spirit of God, it says, &#8220;The Spirit of God moved&#8221;. So expect the act of movement when you are dealing with prayers. The fact that my times are in His hands makes me be at peace for my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus. God knows what we need but He still requires us to move His hands by praying.<b> Philippians 4:6, &#8220;Be anxious for nothing, but by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, make your request be known to God<\/b>&#8220;. Stop worrying about what has not happened yet or what should have happened by now and go back to calling His name when you do not know what to do. The servant had been given a task, he did not know what to do but pray and move.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Prayers cannot be successful without thanksgiving. The scripture from<b> Philippians 4:6,  says &#8220;..,with thanksgiving<\/b>&#8221; makes it clear how thanksgiving is part of prayers. Thanksgiving is not only reserved when you have received it, it\u2019s executed on the verge of waiting for it. This eliminates anxiety, frustrations and lack of patience. We write letters for job applications, at the end of the letter we tend to write, <b><u> &#8220;thanking you in advance<\/u><\/b>&#8220;, Pause for a sec, you don&#8217;t have the job yet and might not have it but there is a \u201cthank you\u201d word. You have faith based on your qualifications that you can get that job but you leave it in the hands of the hiring manager to make a decision. It&#8217;s the same way with prayer, you submit your request and conclude it with a thanksgiving. This means you have faith not in yourself but in God who is able to do it.<b> Genesis 24:26, &#8220;Then the man bowed down his head and worshipped the Lord, 27, And he said, &#8220;Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken His mercy and His truth toward my master.<u> As for me, being on the way, the Lord led me to the house of my master&#8217;s brethren.<\/u><\/b> Though he had just seen the signs, he went and worshipped the Lord. Yes Rebekah had all the qualities he had prayed for, he gives her gifts but does not tell her why he is there and does not even know whether she and her family will accept the proposal but he worships God any way. He understands that God has led him this far and He will lead him that far. Those who are in God&#8217;s will are led of Him from the start to the finish.<b> Psalms 37:23, &#8220;The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in His way<\/b>&#8220;. This is for those who are walking within the boundaries of God&#8217;s will. Being led means going somewhere and not just sitting and stagnant. Effective prayers call for a move. Moving from the familiar to the unfamiliar, from what you are used to, to what you are not used to. Greater things happen in the unfamiliar grounds. Therefore you pray, move as you are led and you see what you prayed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Maybe you have prayed for something for a long time, you were specific, it was within the boundaries of His will. See what you prayed and know if the Lord made your JOURNEY (MOVE) prosperous or not. Be open to whichever way the Lord might speak to you because it might not always happen how you expected it. Give Him praise and thanksgiving while you are on the verge of waiting and know that your steps are ordered of Him. Find what His will is and stay in it if you ever want to succeed. You might have stepped out of it and went your way because you waited for too long. It&#8217;s never too late to get back on the track to be led by Him.<b><u> God only delights in our ways when He orders our steps<\/u><\/b>, when He goes before us, what prayers are about, we will be calling on God to lead. I believe that this is the year of God&#8217;s favor for some of you if not all. Don&#8217;t be surprised when you see what you prayed being manifested because it was within God&#8217;s will. We are yet to hear testimony after testimony of what the Lord is doing. One last thing, I believe in praying with eyes opened, praying and watching to see when the Lord is passing by.

I find that what someone needs is most likely what I also need. In the process of encouraging them, I also get encouraged. I get a new understanding of a scripture and often time God allows me to develop a word out of it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">One of one favorite subjects to speak on is Prayer. I find a good flow as I do it. It is my strength, it builds my faith. I am more stronger in praying than I am in the word. I find it much easier to pray than read my bible. Now we know that praying is not a one way but two ways. It&#8217;s easy to talk to God but hard to wait and hear what He has to say. I envy those people who stand to say the Lord spoke to them. God speaks to people differently, some through visions, dreams, through someone else, through His words, through signs and wonders. I don&#8217;t know how the Lord does speak to you but I am yet to hear the Lord speak to me audibly. I can sense when He is speaking to me at times when he drops a word in my spirit or when he drops a thought. When I begin to ponder on it, the more I get revelation the more I can tell He is speaking to me. This is one of the ways He speaks to me. What happens when you have prayed for something over and over again and all you are waiting is to hear God speak to you maybe audibly over what to do about the situation? I will share a concept from a passage that has been a blessing to me over the years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Genesis 24 has really taught me so much about praying and waiting to hear what the Lord has to say. In this case,<b> it&#8217;s not about what the Lord said but what the Lord did<\/b>.<b> The message was not in what He spoke but what He did<\/b>. The reason why the person in the picture knew it was God is because He had prayed SPECIFICALLY for something. Abraham&#8217;s servant was given a task to find a wife for Isaac. He had been given guidelines as where he should find her from. He has no description of what to look for but he applies wisdom of God&#8217;s will for a good wife. He SPECIFICALLY prays to God about those qualities. &#8220;<b>The lips of the righteous knows what is acceptable&#8221; Proverbs 10:32<\/b> tells me. Staying in the word will teach you more of what God&#8217;s will is for mankind, there after when we know what the boundaries are, we pray within those boundaries (guidelines).<b> The train finds complete freedom to flow within the boundaries it&#8217;s given<\/b> and so is a righteous man who knows the boundaries of what is accepted.<b><u> Praying within boundaries is not an indication that you will get all you&#8217;ve prayed but allowing the God of the boundaries to exercise His will for YOUR life in that which you have prayed for<\/u><\/b>. God&#8217;s word is &#8220;THE WILL&#8221; for ALL but when you pray the will, He sees out of the total WILL what He desires for you to have at a given time and does it. Here is where we many times we struggle, waiting patiently for the will to manifest in God&#8217;s way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">The servant prayed God&#8217;s will, finished praying and started watching to see what the Lord would do. Here comes Rebekah, who does everything he had prayed to God for,<b> Genesis 24:21, &#8220;And the man, wondering at her, remained silent so as to know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not<\/b>&#8220;. Can you see he wasn&#8217;t waiting for God to send thunder, angel to speak to him or God Himself appear and say, &#8220;Servant, I have heard your prayer and now I have come to perform&#8221;. For this man, all the speaking he needed was to see what He had prayed being fulfilled. Watch this, when he saw all that he prayed coming true, he did not jump and conclude. He sat patiently to see if the Lord had prospered his way or not. The only reason he finally knew it was God&#8217;s will was, he had peace within, he did not struggle or fight for it, no one else came for comparison, and there is no indication that he moved to another place. When I have prayed for something within the boundaries for a long time, I cease to pray so as to see what I have prayed. Ceasing to pray and watching does not mean I gave up it means that<b> I activated the will and now it&#8217;s time to watch it&#8217;s manifestation in silence<\/b>. I believe the people who never pray specifically have a way of missing God&#8217;s will, why? because you could be praying and praying and God is doing something but you can&#8217;t see as you won&#8217;t know. You could be waiting for God to speak to you in another way more so audibly and miss what He was doing to show He was speaking. See what you prayed, to continue..

God has given us today to make good use as we live one day at a time. There is a song we used to sing, &#8220;<b>One day at a time sweet Jesus, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m asking from you, just give me strength to do everyday what I have do, yesterday is gone sweet Jesus, and tomorrow may never be mine, Lord help me today, show me the way one day at a time&#8221;.<\/b> <\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Over and over again the bible addresses today, Jesus said, &#8220;<b>do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will take care of itself<\/b>&#8221; in other words, deal with what you have today, what has already been supplied. Worrying about tomorrow or something that has not happened yet is not healthy for there is a possibility of wasting today. Today&#8217;s wasted can never be recovered, for time is precious. I&#8217;m learning most of these the hard way. &#8220;<b>Choose ye this day whom you will serve&#8221;. <\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">There are things we need to do that many times we neglect them thinking that we have a lot of time to do them another day. This is where the word procrastination comes in. P<b>rocrastination is to postpone or delay needlessly, to put off doing something, especially out of habitual carelessness or laziness<\/b>. Someone said,<\/span><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">procrastination is the thief of time<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">to which I am a victim. Procrastination becomes very serious when something of priority is neglected for example, there are people reading this who have not repented of their sins and put their trust in Jesus Christ alone for their eternal salvation. They are still procrastinating with an idea, \u201cI have a lot of time to one day do it\u201d. If tomorrow is promised to no one,<\/span><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">today is your day of salvation.<\/span><\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Salvation should be a priority because the day of the Lord is approaching.<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">To put this to perspective, let\u2019s look at David facing Goliath. For 40 days the Israelites under the leadership of Saul had been threatened and constantly postponed or delayed  their attack, later David comes into the scene and sees an opportunity to do something for there was a man who was blaspheming the name of the Living God. Remember David was not suppose to be here, he was not a warrior at this point, had no training or weapons, and had  no army to  back him up yet he is not even looking for time to go and train, build up an army and get his weapons. He understands that if he is going to fight, it&#8217;s either now or never.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">1Samuel 17:46, &#8220;<u>This day the Lord<\/u><\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you&#8230; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel&#8221;.<\/span><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">This day, today, this hour I got to deal with this<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">. As he is saying &#8220;this day&#8221;, he has God in mind to help him overcome this day. I have so many Goliaths I have been delaying fighting because of the fear just like Saul and his people. I don&#8217;t want to postpone them for tomorrow or another day, I want to face them today. You can tell that they did not mention the name of the Lord in their situation therefore for 40 days, they were afraid of facing one man. David comes to win not tomorrow but today. Not only is he planning on winning today, he has a strategy of doing it, one,<\/span><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">the Lord will deliver you in my hands<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">; two,<\/span><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">I will strike you and take your head from you<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">; three,<\/span><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/u><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">my reason for doing this is to let the whole earth know that there is a God in Israel<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">.

Delaying them more may not help resolve them. Postponing paying bills, certain duties and tasks, certain responsibilities is not healthy. Let&#8217;s all begin to identify things we have been putting aside that we need to deal with, face, fight and say like David, &#8220;<b>This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand&#8221;<\/b>. The Lord is giving us grace to deal with this day, check this out,<b> Exodus 32:29, For Moses had said, consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you blessings this day&#8221;, Deuteronomy 11:26, &#8220;Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse&#8221;.<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">If the Lord is mostly talking about this day, we too can live one day at a time dealing with things we have been postponing for so long.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\">Thanks<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\">Evans<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><\/p>\n<p><\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Samuel 17:46, &#8220;THIS DAY the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you&#8230;

Jude tells us that we need to<b><i><u> CONTEND EARNESTLY for the faith<\/u><\/i><\/b>.  To do something earnestly is to be intense and serious in one&#8217;s mentality regarding the matter at hand.  Is there any matter greater than the Gospel?  Proverbs 28:1 reminds us, &#8220;\u2026the righteous are as bold as a lion.&#8221;  The lion is known for its boldness, for its roar, for its presence.  Should not the Christian be bold in his or her witness in the midst of false teachers?  In part 2 we examined the difference between someone being in error and someone being classified as a heretic.  Carlton Pearson, is a well know preacher, yet denies the existence of Hell, TD Jakes does not believe in the trinity.  We must be ever so careful as to those that are preaching what they think is the Gospel, but is really not.  Remember all it takes is a teaspoon of rat poisoning to kill you.  Paul said it like this,  &#8220;In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,<sup> 5<\/sup> To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<sup> 6<\/sup> Your glorying<i> is<\/i> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump (1 Cor. 5:1)?  Jude says of those bringing in the poisonous doctrine and sinful practices, &#8220;<b><i>For certain men have crept in unnoticed<\/i>.&#8221; <\/b> This is a scary thing when the church cannot notice the wolves in sheep clothing come to devour the sheep.  We are to contend, speak for the Gospel and we have the mandate to speak against the deceptive messages that some have to preached which are false gospels.  Does this mean that we are to argue with people?  Paul wrote to Timothy, &#8220;But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.<sup> 24<\/sup> And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all<i> men<\/i>, apt to teach, patient<\/span>\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> <\/span>\ufeff<span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">,<sup> 25<\/sup> In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;<sup> 26<\/sup> And<i> that<\/i> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will (2 Tim 2:23 -25).  &#8220;You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine (Titus 2:1),&#8221; as you &#8220;Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers (2 Tim4:16).&#8221;  This is why we are instructed to, &#8220;<sup>2Ti 4:2<\/sup> Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage\u2014with great patience and careful instruction.  <sup> 2Ti 4:3<\/sup> For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear (2 Tim 4:2, 3).&#8221;  Saints, we must be diligent to preach the Word in and out of season.  When you share the gospel with others, be diligent to make sure that the gospel that you hear, and share with others is truly the Gospel according to Jesus Christ, for no others &#8220;gospel&#8221; can transform a life to become like the person of Jesus Christ.  Take time to go through the Gospel this week and read the very words of Jesus Christ and examine how you might apply what God reveals to you through them in your life.  <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessing, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;

Christ\u2019s death, because it was a death of substitution for sin, satisfied God\u2019s justice and exhausted His wrath toward His elect, so that Christ actually purchased believers from slavery to sin and from the sentence of eternal death. For a broken law to be satisfied a blood sacrifice was required and<b> Leviticus 17:11<\/b> tells us that, \u201c<b>The life of the flesh is in the blood<\/b>\u201d and if a life sheds blood, there is no more life left hence death. That is what the law does; it demands a blood sacrifice for it to be satisfied.<b> Ezekiel 18:20, \u201cThe soul that sins shall die\u201d, Romans 6:23, \u201cfor the wages of sin is death\u2026\u201d <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Thank God for His saving plan, even when we were not worth saving (redeeming), He saved (redeemed) us through His blood. Ephesians 1:7 redemption through His blood.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> The term used here relates to paying the required ransom to God for the release of a person from bondage. Christ\u2019s sacrifice on the cross paid that price for every elect person enslaved by sin, buying them out of the slave market of iniquity.<b><u> The price of redemption was death<\/u><\/b><u> .<b> Now only saving faith unlocks the door of the prison where the law keeps men bound, kept under guard by the law<\/b><\/u><b>.<\/b> Paul personifies the law as a jailer of guilty, condemned sinners,<b> ON DEATH ROW<\/b> awaiting God\u2019s judgment (Rom. 6:23).

We will not enter into heaven primarily because we have accepted Christ, we will enter into heaven because God has accepted us through His Son Jesus. A certain preacher, Paul Washer in one of his preaching gave this analogy, if for example I went to White House, I will not be accepted into White House because I know President George W. Bush, I can only be accepted into White House because he knows me and he has invited me.

When I understand this then I am reminded that there is nothing good in me but Christ as when I got saved nothing in me changed only my spirit and so this enables me to understand that someone somewhere has a chance to come to the Lord. All I got to do is put my light on top of the table that they may see the light of Christ in me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Gal 2:20, &#8220;I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live but not I but Christ lives inside of me; the life that I now live in the flesh, I live by faith&#8221;.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"> Once again we see that when we got saved, Christ took over, I have no reason to boast about anything, I am not better than any unbelievers. If we look in the book of Exodus, we see what had been happening in the land of Egypt as the children of Israel were afflicted, we see God coming to their rescue not to protect the Israelites because they were better than the Egyptians, but because they were His people. I pray that we will never forget that we are blessed, protected, cared for not because we are better but because we are His people and He has favored us. God gives grace to His followers not based on merit but His loving Kindness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">We see that darkness is the ninth plague being introduced in the land of Egypt, if you read from the time when the plagues started in Egypt, the children of Israel were also in the land only that, down in Goshen where they were, God had put a hedge of protection around them that none of the plagues affected them. When the ninth plague was executed, it affected the land for three days. Now this was no ordinary darkness, this was a huge one for it was dark in the day and at night and darkness was so thick that people could not see each other for those three days. The bible gives us a glimpse of how it was in Goshen and that is,<b> the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.<\/b> Weird things happen in the darkness, but God allows you to be in the light and darkness has no choice but surrender. Fear comes in the dark, going towards the wrong direction can be a result that you are not seeing the way, many bad things happen in darkness but when we are all in the light, we are at a better place. We are living in a world full of darkness that&#8217;s why we hear rapes, murder, kidnapping, immorality, divorce and many crazy things happening but thank God for Jesus, the light of the world. He says,<b> John 9:5, &#8220;As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world&#8221;,<\/b> He being in us causes us to shine.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">2Cor 6:17, &#8220;Therefore come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">, The children of Israel were to live a separate life allowing God to come to their rescue when they needed Him the most and once again living this separate life was not to make them any better than the Egyptians but this was to allow the Egyptians to see that they were different and what made a difference in their lives was God Himself. We need to separate and allow the light of Christ to shine in our little Goshen that many may see the Christ inside of us. This goes about our talk, what we listen to, what we watch, what we associate ourselves with, places we go to and the rest. We all need to examine our ways and see if we are allowing something to put off the light we have been given. Let&#8217;s be like the five wise virgins who had their light on all the time that when the groom showed up, they were found ready. What is your little Goshen this morning, it could be your office, cube, apartment, your car, you name it. Your cube could be a light house when your surrounding is clouded with darkness. I believe that the moment people begin to see the light, they may desire to know what lights you up, so let your light shine before men, put it where it can be seen not to impress but for someone to know that Jesus is the Light of the world which is in darkness. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Exodus 11:21-23, &#8220;&#8230;But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings&#8221; We have all been allowed an awesome opportunity to affect our surrounding.

A time of refreshing in the presence of the Lord. A time to forget about everything that has been bringing you down and meditate on the word of God. Being busy many times rob us opportunity to pray or read the bible like we should. Martin Luther said,<b> &#8220;I have so much to do today that I have to spend the first two hours in prayer<\/b>&#8221; (paraphrased). What a way to look and face the day, so much to do but first spend the first few hours in prayers. We many times change it to,<b> &#8220;I have so much to do today that I have no time to pray at all<\/b>&#8220;.  It&#8217;s like you have a tree to chop down, how fast it comes down will depend on the tool you are using and how sharp it is. For Martin Luther, he had so many trees to chop down that he needed two hours of sharpening his tools through prayer. Close out everything, enter into your closet, into the inner courts and sharpen all the tools you need to get the job done everyday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">Moses had been called by God to the mountain one time. This means for a time he will escape dealing with murmuring and complaining people. Away from the people who looked up to him with expectations and questions. I believe Moses needed some time to rest and recuperate with the greatest thing, time in the presence of the Lord. In as much as it&#8217;s time to get a way, he is going up to meet the Lord.<b> Vs 16, &#8220;Now the glory of the Lord rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days<\/b>&#8220;. What first runs through my mind is the word &#8220;GLORY&#8221;.<b> Glory is Majestic beauty and splendor<\/b>. This is the best definition I could get to describe the glory of the Lord. Who wants to stay away from His glory? Here is Moses at the mountain; he is engulfed in the mist of the glory of the Lord covered with cloud. Everything around him looks beautiful and splendid, he can smell the fragrance of the glory. He has never seen anything like this anywhere in the world after all they are in the dessert. The scorch of heat, dust, sweat is what he always experienced but now he finds himself in the mist something one cannot describe. For six days he is locked in. &#8220;<b>And on the seventh day He called to Moses out of the mist of the cloud&#8221;<\/b>. This is like going past the gates of praise right into the sanctuary where he could seek God face to face. What an experience that I desire even more<b>, Psalm 91:1, &#8220;He that dwells in the secret of the Most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty<\/b>&#8220;<b> Psalm 91:14, &#8220;Because he has set his love upon ME, therefore I will deliver him, I will set him on high, because he has known My name<\/b>&#8220;. This was Moses\u2019 experience and this too can be ours if we truly seek it. For forty days and forty nights, Moses was away from all the pressures of the earth. I can&#8217;t imagine him thinking of where he came from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">In Exodus 32:7, &#8220;And the Lord said to Moses, &#8220;Go, get down! for your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">&#8220;. All these time he has been up there with the Lord, learning, being given instructions, engulfed in the presence of God, meanwhile back in down where he came from, people are going a stray. God sends him back to where he came from.<b> I believe real ministry starts when you have left the presence of the Lord to exercise what you have learnt before Him<\/b>. In as much as I would love to spend every time in His presence, I have work to do. Many (especially unsaved) have not reached that level yet and my work and your work is to teach them God&#8217;s ways that they too may experience what we do when we are in the presence of the Lord. Moses who had an opportunity to be in His presence forever came back to the people with God&#8217;s commandments which was to teach them the things the Lord showed him. It&#8217;s tough to come back and start dealing with things you escaped for a while but it is necessary. Your coming and my coming up the mountain was to get us ready for the for work. In Psalm 51 after David asked for forgiveness, his next move was to teach transgressors God&#8217;s ways. After Peter had a vision from the Lord at his resting time, he was sent to Cornelius\u2019 house to preach to them. It was tough for him because he considered them unclean or unfit but that is the place God sent him. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\">The thing about being away and coming back is, going away gives you time to be refreshed in the Lord, coming back allows you to now face what sent you away in the first place. Trials, temptations, whatever you got convicted of while you were away now awaits you to deal with them, your work is to set your house in order. Attitude adjustment, revived, strengthened, encouraged, established, your face glowing from having met the Lord. Thank God for those times alone in His presence. Thanks be to Him for brining us up to where He wants to reach out to us and later sends us to continue with the work He started in our lives. You may have prayed, &#8220;<b>Father take me away from this world to be with you forever&#8221;,<\/b> Jesus prays,<b> &#8220;Father keep them in this world, only keep them away from the wicked one<\/b>&#8220;.

He is leading a people who have not stopped complaining from day one even up to this every moment. Many times God wanted to kill the children of Israel because of their complains and murmuring but Moses kept on pleading with God. On this day in Exodus 17, the people had just complained as usual about something they were lacking. Already God had given them everything they cried for and this time they needed water and instead of looking to God, they begin to reflect on how they would have been satisfied in Egypt. How possible it is that<b> You can be heading to the promise land while Egypt could still be present in your life<\/b>. Every time you face a tough situation, your first place to look at Egypt, a place come from.<b> You can be out of Egypt but Egypt may not be out of you<\/b>. Egypt represents the world where when we got saved, a deliverer Moses (Holy Spirit) came to lead us out of bondage but in the process of being led, one&#8217;s eyes were still fixed on Egypt.<b> Egypt was a land of less than enough, then brought into the wilderness was a land of just enough and God was bringing them to a land of more than enough<\/b>. We have to reach at a place of not always operating in the land of just enough to which the provision is always by miracle to a land of more than enough, a land of blessings. I refuse to live by miracles everyday, yes the miracles are good for miracles are to get me from point A to point B but living under blessings is always having the provision.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">So the people complained and God told Moses in<b> Exodus 17:6, &#8220;Behold, I stand before thee there upon the rock of Horeb; and<u> thou shall smite the rock<\/u>, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel&#8221;<\/b> This is what the Lord chose for this time and that was for Moses to hit the rock for water come out. Now let&#8217;s look at another time the Lord wanted to provide water to the children of Israel in<b> Numbers 20:8, &#8220;Take thy rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother,<u> and speak unto the rock<\/u> before their eyes; and it shall give thee forth water, and thou shall bring forth to them water out of the rock&#8221;.<\/b> So we see one instant Moses is asked to strike the rock and another instant he is asked to speak to the rock. God can do anything at any time using any method He chooses, He is God. Don\u2019t expect Him to move the same way He moved the first time, He is not limited to our planning. When you expect the Lord to come through the door, don&#8217;t be surprised if He comes in through the window.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Amazing thing about the whole story with the children of Israel is every time they complained and God felt like wiping them out, Moses defended them but at one point Moses got fed up with their cry, complain and murmur and so He took the word of the Lord but began to speak to the people in an anger and instead of obeying the Lord, his anger caused him to strike the rock twice instead of speaking to it .<b>Num 20:11, &#8220;And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice&#8221;.<\/b> Yes the Lord gave the children of Israel water even though Moses disobeyed but Moses was left to suffer the consequences.<b> Eph 4:26, &#8220;Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath&#8221;.<\/b> It&#8217;s very easy to get angry and do something you will regret and the enemy knows how to bring people your way that will try and push you to anger. Moses was on the verge of entering the promise land but because of his anger that led him to disobey God caused him the land he had waited to see for 40 years. Be careful about how you deal with things under anger and frustrations for you could be killing what the Lord had been planning to do in your life from day one. As we have seen in the book of Ephesians, \u201cbe angry and sin not\u201d is very true for the enemy will always look for ways to make you stumble and fall and as Moses tells us in<b> Deut 1:37, &#8220;The Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying even you shall not go in there&#8221;,<\/b> people pushed him to the limit, don&#8217;t allow people and situations push you to the limit for you could do something you will regret for a long time. Be cool, be still, calm yourself, don&#8217;t fight fire with fire but be the fire extinguisher, don&#8217;t give the enemy an inch for he will want the whole thing, be angry if you must but don&#8217;t let it cause you to sin.<b> Anger is one letter short for DANGER<\/b><\/span><span style=\"color:navy;\">.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify;margin:0;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS';\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;color:#000000;\"> <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span style=\"font-family:Shruti;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Deut 1:37, &#8220;The Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying even you shall not go in there&#8221; In Exodus 17:6, Moses is leading the children of Israel from the land of Egypt moving towards the promise land.

Not only did Peter give these warnings, but the Apostle John did as well.  There are some that are preaching and confessing that Jesus Christ did not come in the flesh.  Now there are many preachers out there that would certainly fit into this category, but a group that is even more subtle and equally as dangerous is the preachers and groups that preach that Jesus did come in the flesh, but they preach a different Jesus other than then One in the Scriptures.  Jesus said, concerning the Judgment Day, &#8220;<b><u>Many<\/u> will say to Me in that day, &#8216;Lord, Lord, have we <\/b><\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?&#8217;<sup> <\/sup><\/span><\/b><b><sup><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><\/b><b><sup><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">23<\/span><\/sup><\/b><b><sup><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/sup><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> And <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">then I will declare to them, &#8216;I never knew you; <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!&#8217;  Also in Matt 7:13<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">, &#8220;<b>Enter by the narrow gate; for wide<i> is<\/i> the gate and broad<i> is<\/i> the way that leads to destruction, and there are<u> many<\/u> who go in by it<\/b>.&#8221; It should not be a surprise that John writes,<b><i>  <\/i><\/b><\/span><b><i><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\ufeff<\/span><\/i><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> For <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\ufeff\ufeff<\/span><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">many<\/span><\/u><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ<i> as<\/i> coming in the flesh\u2026 <\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> There are so many deceivers in our world, and there is something we must listen for to discern who is true and who is false.

John MacArthur writes,<b> A failure to be faithful to the fundamental, sound doctrines of the faith (a proper view of the person and work of Christ, love, obedience) marks a person as having never been born again (1 John 2:23; 3:6\u201310; 4:20,21; 5:1\u20133). The word &#8220;abide&#8221; has the idea of constant adherence and warns that these fundamentals are not open to change or subject to the latest trends or philosophical fads.&#8221;  We must abide in the doctrine (teaching) of Jesus Christ, it is crucial for us to be in the Word of God daily, not every other day, or every once in a while.  There are many heretics preaching at this time.  There are those that deny the Infallibility of Scripture; the denial of Substitutionary Atonement; etc.) A<i> heretic<\/i> is one who therefore denies the Faith and cannot be a true Christian (<\/b><a title=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=\" href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=2Peter+2-3\"><b>2 Peter 2-3<\/b><\/a><b>). The use of the term should be reserved for clear cases (like &#8216;Bishop&#8217; John Spong; Kenneth Copeland; Benny Hinn; the Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses; the Mormons; etc.)<\/b><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><br \/><span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><b><i>Error<\/i><\/b> is a departure from Biblical Truth, but generally one not so serious as to deny the Faith. Peter was in error when Paul rebuked him openly to his face, but Peter was not a heretic.  Errors can be major and serious (bordering right on heresy &#8211; like denial of eternal punishment), through to minor (&#8216;how many angels are there in heaven&#8217; stuff). They usually have negative impacts on practice and other doctrines. Such a person who embraces such things is<i> in error<\/i> (or even<i> in serious error<\/i>), but should be rebuked\/challenged\/dialogued with, lovingly as a brother (<\/span><a title=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=\" href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=1Corinthians+11:19\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">1 Corinthians 11:19<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">; <\/span><a title=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=\" href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=2Corinthians+10:1\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">2 Corinthians 10:1<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">; <\/span><a title=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=\" href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Hebrews+5:11-14\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Hebrews 5:11-14<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">) until their conscience is changed or our own error exposed.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><br \/><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Essentially, this is one of the reasons why we need the Body\/Church (assuming it holds to the Word Alone doctrine). Error does not normally refer to such things as alcohol, movies or other questions of Christian liberty where there can be diversity\/liberty of application within basic principles &#8211; unless one turns their principles into laws and tries to impose it on other&#8217;s consciences (cf <\/span><a title=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=\" href=\"http:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Romans+14\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Romans 14<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">). Hence &#8211; someone who promotes the<i> prosperity<\/i> teaching but is otherwise &#8216;sound&#8217; is in serious error but not a heretic. (Indeed &#8216;denominations&#8217; have arisen to allow people with differences of conscience to worship the way they believe while still recognizing others as true Christians (unlike Rome who has taught that &#8220;outside the [Roman] church there is no salvation&#8221;).<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><br \/><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">These are some of the basic distinctions that can be made between<i> Heresy<\/i> and<i> Error<\/i>, and are essential when dealing with issues of discernment and deception in the Church.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size:100%;\">Brothers and sisters, please be sure to abide in the doctrine of Christ, by reading, and studying His Word, the Words of truth daily and of course obeying what you read.

There are days everyone is so overwhelmed by things that you just can&#8217;t take it no more. Frustrations have pushed you to the edge that how to deal with them are nearly impossible. You have tried to strengthen yourself but you find yourself back to worrying, helpless and confused. Tears roll down your cheeks and you just can&#8217;t help stop it. You wish that the people you love are around to help you overcome what you have to deal with but still that doesn&#8217;t happen. What do you do? I have been there, felt it, wanted to run away, cried myself to sleep but in all I learnt more about the one who knows my down sitting and my uprising, the one who is familiar with my ways. He knows when I am so weak and just need to stop and cry.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:12px;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;\">It&#8217;s easy to see someone stand strong as a soldier but like a song goes, &#8220;<b>they don&#8217;t know that I would go running home when I fall down, they don&#8217;t know who picks me up when no one is around, I drop my sword and cry for just a while, cause deep inside this armor, the warrior is a child<\/b>&#8220;. Many people tend to see the armor but let them take a deeper look and see that inside that armor, the person in it has the heart of a child. A heart that can melt, be broken, be scared but that is okay because it teaches you more on who to depend on. God does bring us to those seasons so that our confidence is not in any man but in Him. <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:12px;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;\">Psalm 94:17, &#8220;Unless the Lord had been my help, My soul would have settled in silence<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;\">&#8220;, Had it not been for the Lord&#8217;s help, whatever I do or what other people have done would have either failed or just became a temporary solution to my problem. In a case like this, who can give peace apart from God? Many times it&#8217;s the peace that is needed to endure. If you had peace inside, even if the situation did not change, adapting to it made you comfortable. Comfort does not mean you are okay with but it means you handle it and survive without it pulling you down. God helps us so that we are at peace because His peace surpasses all human understanding. The bible says in<b> Philippians 4:7, &#8220;And the peace<u> OF<\/u> God&#8230;&#8221;,<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:12px;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;\">it&#8217;s the peace that originates from above, no one can give it but Him.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:12px;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;\">Vs. 18, &#8220;If I say, &#8220;My foot slips,&#8221; Your mercy, O Lord, will hold me up<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;\">&#8220;. Mercy and grace tends to work together, when you have peace inside, God gives the grace to endure. Paul after praying three times for something to be removed, God&#8217;s word came to him in<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:12px;\"> <\/span><\/b><b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;\">2Corinthians 12:9, &#8220;And He said to me, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, My strength is made perfect in weakness&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;\">.

The Gospel of John 1:1 takes us back to the origin to understand how the word of God is connected to Jesus.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God, everything was created by the word and were it not for God, nothing that has been created could have been created.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> As you continue to read down the same chapter<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">, you will see how the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory of the Son of God<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">. John tells us that Jesus existed from the beginning, contrary to what some people believe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">The word is a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path. We read the word with understanding. Jesus said,<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> John 14:6, &#8220;I am the way, the truth and the life, no man comes to the Father but by me<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">&#8220;, already Jesus has stated clearly that He is the way and knowing that He is the word Himself He is the one who will guide us through the paths of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">Remember how God came through for the Israelites when they faced hard times as they were journeying to the promise land, God went before them by day as a cloud of wind and by night as a pillar of fire. We know how fire provides light and also fire consumes anything on its path, and by this I believe God meant that He will not just shine their way but also clear their path the reason for a lamp unto your feet and a light unto your path.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">The more we know the word and the God of the word, the more we can be stirred up in the right direction.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> Psalm 37:23, &#8220;The good steps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord, He delights in his ways and whichever way he turns, he will prosper&#8221;<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">. I do struggle getting the word inside, meditating on it and memorizing it but I know that the more I do what I struggle with, the more I can see my way clearly because getting hold of the word means getting hold of the One who knows the way. People who do not know and are unsure of the way tend to go in circles wasting time and getting lost again and again, finding themselves in wrong places. They are not progressing and growing because they are stuck in the same place. When we are confident who is leading the way, though we may go through the valleys of the shadow of death, we will not fear evil for He knows the way and we are following.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">How much of the word is a lamp unto your feet and a light unto your path. Are we reading the word without fail, let me go a step forward, are we STUDYING the word or are we waiting for Sunday morning for the word to be preached? Are we memorizing the word and applying them in our lives? and are we checking the words we hear from preaching, teachings and devotions to prove they are written and are applied correctly? Even in my weakness I desire to know the word and the God of the word.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> Psalm 86:11 &#8220;Teach me your ways oh Lord and I will walk in your truth, unite my heart to fear our name&#8221;, Psalm 25:4&amp;5, &#8220;show me your ways O Lord, teach me your paths.

The first thing is<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> VISION.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">  Jesus had asked the disciples to cross over to the other side of the sea while Jesus sent home the people who came to listen to Him preach. While the disciples were crossing, their rose a great wind that tossed the ship and they could not navigate it properly. In the midst of panic and confusion, Jesus appears at a distance and their immediate response was that they had seen a ghost, as they had never seen Him walk on water. Jesus reveals Himself without changing the situation and Peter takes a closer look at Him and gets a vision. Every believer needs to have a vision, something to look a head for, something you desire to accomplish with God\u2019s help in the midst of storm of life. The bible says that \u201c<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">where there is no vision people perish, Pro 29:18\u201d<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">. Vision starts life into something dead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">Having a vision in your life causes you to have a<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> DESIRE<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">; this is the second key. Well many people tend to use this line, \u201cwhatever the Lord decides for me, let it be\u201d. Wait a minute; He has allowed us to present our desires in line with His will. Jesus\u2019 desire was His wish for the cup of suffering to pass Him nevertheless He gave up His will for the Father\u2019s.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> Mark 11:24, \u201cWhat things so ever you desire\u2026.\u201d<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> This reminds us that we have desires and if our desires are confined within His will, God is faithful to make it happen. Desire could be a better position, a call in the ministry, your loved ones to be saved and many more are desires. But desires do not come about until you\u2019ve visioned it or in other words you\u2019ve seen something good at a distance and you desire it even before you receive it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">Desire progresses<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> FAITH,<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> this is interesting because if you read the story, it wasn\u2019t Jesus idea for Peter to come, it was Peter\u2019s idea as He had seen the Son of God walk on water and he understood his relationship to Him in the sense that if He could do it, then he (Peter) could because<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> it\u2019s not by might nor by power but by His Spirit says the Lord, Zech 4:6<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> He understood that if he was going to attempt the impossible, He had to have faith in God. His faith in Christ causes him to step out from the possible to the impossible<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">. Faith tends to defy the laws of nature, as it does not depend on facts. The reason why he could step out of the boat boldly is because He had asked Jesus<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> vs. 28. \u201c Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on water\u201d<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">. He is telling the Lord exactly how he wants to come to Him and all he is asking for is the Lord\u2019s approval. We can go before God with our desires, Him approving it is a sign of victory. Before David could engage himself in any battle, he asked for the Lord\u2019s approval. The moment God approved, it was an indication of victory for the Lord was going to help him win.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> You need to initiate your desire to Him that He may act on it according to His will<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">Heb 12:2, \u201clooking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith\u201d.<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> Next is<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> FOCUS<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">. It\u2019s easy to begin something through vision to desire to faith, but it becomes difficult to keep focus till the end because of distractions on the way. Pride can be one; life\u2019s storms can be another to mention a few. These things can be overwhelming to sink you in what you should be overcoming. As long as Peter\u2019s focus was on Christ, everything was fine but the moment his eyes were withdrawn from the<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> supernatural<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> to the<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> natural,<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> he began to sink.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> Looking (focusing) unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">. He gives us more faith when our eyes are fixed on Him but if we loose track and begin to sink, we can call on Him to save us from sinking. Have a vision for your life, begin to desire what you see in the spirit, have faith that you have received them, keep you eyes on Him at all times, in every circumstance and every situation and you will make it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">Last point, Peter\u2019s vision then desire then faith and finally focus was not leading him away from Jesus as anything that the Lord is doing in our lives should not draw us away from Him, it should bring us even closer to Him. Let anything that you are working towards bring you even closer to Him but if you begin to drift, stop and seek the Lord to show you how you can draw closer to Him.<\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Matt 14:22-32, \u201c\u2026Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on water\u2026\u201d Moving people are not stagnant people.

Many illusionists cause one to look in one direction while the illusionist does something in another direction. Illusionist show things that are false hiding what things are true. Peter writes that false teachers are among you and they shall bring damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them and bring them and bring upon themselves swift destruction. Peter tells us:<\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';font-size:14px;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';font-size:11px;\">There are teachers among you now, at this time that are false. These false teachers may be heard on the radio, seen and heard on television, they have authored of books, and of course some preach in churches and or stadiums. Perhaps you listen to some of these false teachers. One must realize that just because a preacher or teacher is popular that does not automatically connote that the preacher is biblical. Hitler was popular, but certainly not a man of integrity, and certainly did not preach truth, using Evolution to substantiate his racial superiority jargon. If a preacher can get a large following, this too does not equate a biblical source in the preacher. Any music celebrity can also gain a large following, can also pack a stadium or concert hall full of people that will scream their name, buy their products, and wear their apparel. The church is not popularity contest. Jesus choose twelve, and one was lost, he did not have a large following in this light, but those that followed him learning to be fishers of men. <\/span><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';font-size:14px;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';font-size:11px;\">How can one recognize a false teacher? Peter answers this question by saying one can recognize a false teacher by realizing the damnable heresies, even denying the Lord bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction.

Such a task is beyond the scope of this article. Furthermore, the attempt to precisely identify and number such a list of doctrines would be an extremely difficult thing to do. However, a reasonable list of fundamentals would necessarily begin with these doctrines explicitly identified in Scripture as<b><u> non-negotiable<\/u><\/b>:<b><u> the absolute authority of Scripture over tradition<\/u><\/b> (sola Scriptura),<b><u> justification by faith alone (sola fide), the deity of Christ, and the Trinity. <\/u><\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">But what are we to do with this understanding? First of all, we should resist any temptation to wield these doctrines like a judge&#8217;s gavel that consigns multitudes to eternal doom. We must not set ourselves up as judges of other people&#8217;s eternal fate. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">On the other hand, we must recognize that those who have turned away from sound doctrine in matters essential to salvation are condemning themselves. &#8220;<b>He who does not believe has been judged already&#8221; (John 3:18).<\/b> Our passion ought to be to proclaim the fundamentals with clarity and precision, in order to turn people away from the darkness of error. We must confront head-on the blindness and unbelief that will be the reason multitudes will one day hear the Lord say,<b> &#8220;I never knew you; depart from Me&#8221; (Matthew 7:23).<\/b> Again, it must be stressed that those who act as if crucial doctrines were of no consequence only heap the false teacher&#8217;s guilt on themselves (2 John 11). <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">We have no right to pronounce a sentence of eternal doom against anyone (John 5:22).<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\"> But by the same token,<b><u> we have no business receiving just anyone into the communion and fellowship of the church<\/u><\/b>. We should no more forge spiritual bonds with people whose religion is fundamentally in error than we would seek fellowship with those guilty of heinous sin. To do so is tantamount to the arrogance shown by the Corinthians, who refused to dismiss from their fellowship a man living in the grossest kind of sin (1 Corinthians 5:1-3). <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><u><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">We must also remember that serious error can be extremely subtle<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif';\">. False teachers don&#8217;t wear a sign proclaiming who they are.

Such doctrines, obviously, involve fundamental articles of genuine Christianity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">The apostle John began his first epistle with a series of statements that establish key points of the doctrine of sin (hamartiology) as fundamental articles of faith.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> &#8220;If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth&#8221; (1:6).<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> That condemns wanton antinomianism (the idea that Christians are under no law whatsoever) and makes some degree of doctrinal and moral enlightenment essential to true Christianity.

The Fundamental Doctrines Are All Summed up in the Person and Work of Christ<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><br \/>Paul wrote,<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> &#8220;No man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221; (1 Corinthians 3:11).<\/span><\/b><b><u><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> Christ Himself embodied or established every doctrine that is essential to genuine Christianity<\/span><\/u><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">. Those who reject any of the cardinal doctrines of the faith worship a christ who is not the Christ of Scripture. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">How are the fundamentals of the faith personified in Christ? With regard to the inspiration and authority of Scripture,<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> He is the incarnate Word (John 1:1, 14). He upheld the written Word&#8217;s absolute authority (Matthew 5:18). Christ Himself established sola Scriptura as a fundamental doctrine when He upbraided the Pharisees for nullifying Scripture with their own traditions: &#8220;Rightly did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, &#8216;This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.&#8217; Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men&#8230;. You nicely set aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition&#8221; (Mark 7:6-9). Our Lord had much to say about the authority and infallibility of the Word of God.<\/span><\/b> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">In the doctrine of justification by faith, it is Christ&#8217;s own perfect righteousness, imputed to the believer, that makes the pivotal difference between true biblical justification and the corrupted doctrine of Roman Catholicism and the cults. That is what Paul meant when he wrote,<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> &#8220;Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes&#8221; (Romans 10:4)<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">. It is also why Paul wrote that Christ is become to us righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30), and it is why Jeremiah called<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> Him &#8220;The Lord our righteousness&#8221; (Jeremiah 23:6).<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> The Lord Himself, Jesus Christ, is our righteousness (Jeremiah 33:16). That is the very essence of justification by faith alone, sola fide. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">Of course, all the fundamental doctrines related to the incarnation&#8211;the Virgin Birth of Christ, His deity, His humanity, and His sinlessness&#8211;are part and parcel of who He is.<\/span><u><\/u><u><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> To deny any of those doctrines is to attack Christ Himself.<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><u><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">The essential doctrines related to His work-His atoning death, His resurrection, and the reality of His miracles-are the very basis of the Gospel (cf. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4; Hebrews 2:3-4).

Since Jesus Himself is the true God incarnate (1 John 5:20; John 8:58; 10:30), the fact of His deity (and by implication the whole doctrine of the Trinity) is a fundamental article of faith (see 1 John 2:23). Our Lord Himself confirmed this when He said all must honor Him as they honor the Father (John 5:23). <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">The truths of Jesus&#8217; divine Sonship and Messiahship are also fundamental articles of faith (John 20:31).<br \/>Of course, the bodily resurrection of Christ is a fundamental doctrine, because<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> 1 Corinthians 15:14 tells us, &#8220;If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain.&#8221;<\/span><\/b> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">Romans 10:9 confirms that the resurrection is a fundamental doctrine, and adds another: the lordship of Christ.<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> &#8220;If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.&#8221;<\/span><\/b> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">And according to Romans 4:4-5, justification by faith is a fundamental doctrine as well:<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> &#8220;Now to the one who works, his wage is not reckoned as a favor, but as what is due. But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\">&#8221; (emphasis added).

The doctrine essentials are the foundation. Apostle John makes Christology the central doctrine of the faith and Paul solidifies with this scripture,<b> &#8220;No man can lay a foundation other than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ&#8221; (1 Corinthians 3:11).<\/b> Thought of sharing in parts this teaching by a bible teacher John F.

Therefore the Gospel message itself must be acknowledged as a primary point of fundamental doctrine.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">But what message will determine the content of our gospel testimony? The biblical message of instantaneous justification through faith alone-or a system of rituals and sacraments that are supposed to convey grace to the participants with no guarantee of ultimate salvation? What authority will we point people to? The Scriptures alone-or a papal hierarchy and church tradition? Those two gospels are flatly contradictory and mutually exclusive.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">All these considerations determine what message we proclaim and whether that message is the authentic Gospel of true Christianity. Therefore we are dealing with matters that go to the very heart of the doctrines Scripture identifies as fundamental.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">Can we get more specific? Let&#8217;s turn to Scripture itself and attempt to lay out some biblical principles for determining which articles of faith are truly essential to authentic Christianity.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">I. All Fundamental Articles of Faith Must Be Drawn from the Scriptures<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">First, if a doctrine is truly fundamental, it must have its origin in Scripture, not tradition, papal decrees, or some other source of authority. Paul reminded Timothy that the Scriptures are &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">able to make thee wise unto salvation&#8221; (2 Timothy 3:15, KJV<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">). In other words, if a doctrine is essential for salvation, we can learn it from the Bible. The written Word of God therefore must contain all doctrine that is truly fundamental. It is able to make us &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">adequate, equipped for every good work&#8221; (2 Timothy 3:17)<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">. If there were necessary doctrines not revealed in Scripture, those promises would ring empty.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">The psalmist wrote, &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul&#8221; (Psalm 19:7<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">). That means Scripture is sufficient. Apart from the truths revealed to us in Scripture, there is no essential spiritual truth, no fundamental doctrine, nothing essential to soul-restoration. We do not need to look beyond the written Word of God for any essential doctrines. There is nothing necessary beyond what is recorded in God&#8217;s Word.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">This, of course, is the Reformation principle of sola Scriptura-Scripture alone. According to the Bible itself, no supposed spiritual authority outside &#8220;the sacred writings&#8221; of Scripture can give us wisdom that leads to salvation.<u><\/u><\/span><u><b><\/b><\/u><u><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">No papal decrees, no oral tradition, no latter-day prophecy can contain truth apart from Scripture that is genuinely fundamental.<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b> <\/p>\n<p><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">II. The Fundamentals Are Clear in Scripture<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">Second, if an article of faith is to be regarded as fundamental, it must be clearly set forth in Scripture. No &#8220;secret knowledge&#8221; or hidden truth-formula could ever qualify as a fundamental article of faith. No key is necessary to unlock the teaching of the Bible.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">The truth of God is not aimed at learned intellectuals; it is simple enough for a child. &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">Thou didst hide these things from the wise and intelligent and didst reveal them to babes&#8221; (Matthew 11:25, KJV).<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\"> The Word of God is not a puzzle. It does not speak in riddles. It is not cryptic or mysterious. It is plain and obvious to those who have spiritual ears to hear. &#8220;<\/span><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple&#8221; (Psalm 19:7).<\/span><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">The point is not that every fundamental article of faith must be supported with an explicit proof text.<\/span><u><\/u><u><b><\/b><\/u><u><b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">The doctrine of the Trinity, for example, is certainly essential to true Christianity&#8211;and it is very clear in Scripture&#8211;but you will find no comprehensive statement of the Trinity from any single passage of Scripture<\/span><\/b><\/u><b><\/b><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">.<\/span> <\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">This does not mean that a doctrine must be non-controversial in order to be considered a fundamental article. Some would argue that the only test of whether something is essential to true Christianity is whether it is affirmed by all the major Christian traditions. By that rule, hardly anything of any substance would remain to distinguish the Christian Gospel from the &#8220;salvation&#8221; offered by pagan morality or Islamic theology. &#8220;There is much truth in the remark of Clement of Alexandria; &#8216;No Scripture, I apprehend, is so favorably treated, as to be contradicted by no one.'&#8221; (Herman Witsius, Sacred Dissertations on the Apostles&#8217; Creed [Phillipsburg, NJ: Presbyterian &amp; Reformed, 1993 reprint], 1:21)<\/span><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;\"> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">Thanks<\/span><br \/><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-size:85%;\">Evans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, I began a study on &#8220;Doctrine Essentials&#8221; from Apostle John&#8217;s epistles.

A child was brought to the disciples to heal but without the presence of Jesus (He was up on the mountain), they were unable to cast out the demon in a boy who was possessed. When the multitude saw Jesus coming, they left the rest of the disciples to meet Him. The bible says, \u201cWhatever is impossible with man, is possible with God and we thank God for His presence to make a difference. His presence alone gives us comfort and courage that all is under His control. Even if He does not fix everything in our lives, the fact that He is present with us in a situation is enough. If He did not fix me, He touched me and His touch kept me from giving up, giving in, throwing in the towel. I have things I have prayed to Him to deal with that have not happened yet but because He keeps touching me when I have to face these things, gives me the strength to linger longer.<\/p>\n<p>So Jesus showed up and He inquired what was going on. <strong>Vs 17-18, &#8220;Then one of the crowd answered and said, &#8220;teacher, I brought my son, who has a mute spirit&#8230;.So I spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they could not&#8221;. <\/strong>The number one thing about this line was faith, they should have asked themselves WDJD \u2013 \u201cWhat Did Jesus Do\u201d in situations like this? The bible says, <strong>\u201cthese signs shall follow them that believe, in my name they shall cast out devils&#8230;\u201d, <\/strong>They were in a position to do what the Master had been doing but because of unbelief as I look at it, they were unable. There were two other things that was required to make this complete. <strong>Heb 11:6, &#8220;Without faith it is impossible to please Him for He that comes to God must first believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him&#8221;.<\/strong> He asked that they bring the boy to Him.<\/p>\n<p>Something interesting is that, when the boy was brought to Jesus, the spirits in the boy became violent, threw the boy on the ground and did all kinds of crazy things to the boy but one thing I love about Jesus, none of these intimidated Him. There is no situation or circumstance in our lives that intimidate Him, just because it&#8217;s worse in our lives and we cannot see the way out can&#8217;t stop Jesus from making something good out of it. Jesus had no problem healing the boy but wanted to make sure that the father of the boy was on the same page, <strong>the father said vs22&#8243;&#8230;But if You can do anything, have compassion on us and help us&#8221;. <\/strong>Here is a man who brought his son to Jesus for healing, already the disciples have failed to do the job, this man&#8217;s faith is shaken because when he needed help the most, the people he thought could offer him help were unable to do so, when he saw Jesus he used the word <strong>\u201cBUT IF\u201d<\/strong>, this indicated his faith was not strong. We need to replace our <strong>\u201cIfs\u201d<\/strong> with <strong>\u201cWHEN\u201d<\/strong> for <strong>&#8220;if&#8221;<\/strong> is for those who have doubt, <strong>&#8220;when&#8221;<\/strong> is for those who have faith in Christ for victory. <strong>vs. 23 &#8220;Jesus said to him, If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.&#8221;<\/strong> Immediately the father of the child cried out and said in tears, <strong><u>&#8220;Lord, I believe; help my unbelief&#8221;.<\/u><\/strong> I thought for a minute, the father said he believed and again he says, help my unbelief? I believe the fathers\u2019 child had strong faith when he came but after meeting the disciples, his faith was shaken and Jesus wanted to bring him back to the first faith he had when he brought his son. And we all know the rest of the story, Jesus cast out the demons and the child was made whole again.<\/p>\n<p>Afterwards the disciples asked Jesus why they could not cast out the demon from the child. After hearing what Jesus had to say, I believe that they had faith that was needed to get the job done but this type needed something more than faith and that is <strong>prayer<\/strong> and <strong>fasting<\/strong>. <strong>vs. 29, &#8220;So He said to them, &#8220;this kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting&#8221;. <\/strong>Faith fuels one to pray, for prayers calls those things which are not as though they were, you call them into existence by faith and for a quick process fasting comes in handy. You can have faith but unless it&#8217;s mixed with prayers and at times with fasting, greater things will never be achieved. Prayer paves a way for God to move. Prayer is the heavy machinery brought to the construction site to help dig out demonic forces and construct something new. If you only had faith, let me tell you that there is more to it and that is having prayers and fasting as part of your life. Are you praying and if so, are you praying like you should? Have you fasted and prayed before? if so when was the last time you prayed and fasted. I am affected by all the three and I need more than what I&#8217;ve got.

The bigger the job, the bigger and the heavier machines.<\/p>\n<p>It happened on one particular day Jesus went to the mountain with three of His closest friends Peter, James and John. The rest of the disciples were left at the bottom of the mountain. These disciples had always been with Jesus and anytime they brought someone who needed a miracle, they were there to witness Jesus perform a miracle. On this particular day, Jesus was not present with them; he was up on mountain where He was transfigured while the rest of the disciples for the first time I believe were faced with a challenge of casting out a demon from a possessed child. What are you to do when the one who always make things happens is missing in action?<\/p>\n<p>Have you always watched someone do something in your presence and then one day that person is not available and a situation arises needing urgent attention and you are expected to be the one to do what you have always watched someone else do? If you have not, the time is coming when you will face them. These are the times your faith is tested to see exactly where it stands. We have had teachings on faith and more, but I wonder whether we put it into practice. One time I took a group to six flags in Massachusetts, we went on different rides, really scary rides. This was my first time; I remember closing my eyes on the first few I went on. Some of the guys refused to go on the big ones. Some guys expected me to cave in with the rest but I began to learn something about faith in that. I told myself I wasn&#8217;t going to back off or close my eyes for the rest of the rides because my faith was built to know that the guys who built those rides knew how safe they are, and to go at such speed and not crush gave me greater confidence. I knew that there were so many people who had been on these rides before me and they made it. I began to think about how many people have walked by faith in the Lord and how God gave them victory. Some of the life rides were so scary, doing high speeds, going through tunnels, dropping 221 feet at a high speed and all they could do was hang in there and trust God to bring them safely to the finish line. We have watched the people who have gone before us, can we have the kind of faith they had. Hebrews 11 tells us more about people who walked by faith and did things by faith. This should serve as a point of reference to all of us. If we can trust certain things created by man, how much more should we trust God even for greater things. Psalm 118:8, <strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s better to trust in the Lord than to put your confidence in man&#8221;.<\/strong> Men have faith on the man made rides, how much more can we trust God then.<\/p>\n<p>Our first great lesson out of this is FAITH.

The reason why the word needs to remain in us is because that it is the blood to sustain and fuel us to move everyday in Him. Check how John reveals to us how the Word is connected to the Lord <strong>John 1:1-5, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the <u>Word was God<\/u>. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. <u>In Him was life, and the life was the light of men<\/u>. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it&#8221;.<\/strong> He was and is the Word, and in Him was life and according to <strong>Leviticus 17:11, &#8220;For the life of the flesh is in the blood&#8230;&#8221;<\/strong>, His Word is life and blood to us. Check how He came to us in <strong>John 1:14, &#8220;And the Word became flesh (blood) and dwelt among us&#8221;. <\/strong>When He broke the bread with the disciples at the last supper, He said eat this bread which represents my body broken for you and the bread is also known as the Word of God. He also said drink this wine which represents the blood of the Lamb shed on the cross of Calvary. Thank God that His blood can now flow in our streams because we are abiding and we can live because He lives. We are not connected to a dead Vine but a living Vine for He is life. The more we know the Word, the more we know Him. The more we can live according to His Words, the more we are imitating the Life of Christ. His words abide in you, His words would steer in the right direction and you will not even work hard to bear fruit, they will come because you are abiding. The reason why the moon shines is because it draws its light and strength from the Sun. We as believers draw our light for the Sun Jesus and we become the Moon that will shine in the middle of darkness., <strong>Matt 5:16, &#8220;Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven&#8221;.You will not bear fruits (shine) unless you abide in Him and His words abide in you.<\/strong> We try so hard to produce fruits while in actual sense we need to abide in Jesus and His Blood and Word will help us grow.<\/p>\n<p>I want us to understand that the Word can speak on it&#8217;s own. Someone said the Word of God does not need an attorney or witnesses, it is able to defend itself anywhere at any time. The Word is powerful and cannot be changed or altered. When we have no voice and at times cannot defend ourselves, the Word of God will stand for sure. The Word will speak in us and for us and at the same time the Word will speak out of us. The moment that the Word leaves us, it does not loose the power and strength but we who have lost it will. <strong>Gen 4:10, &#8220;&#8230; the voice of thy brother&#8217;s blood cries out to Me from the ground&#8221;.<\/strong> When Cain slew Abel, Abel died but his blood cried out to God from the ground when it could not speak from the body anymore, now in <strong>Hebrews 12:24 says, &#8220;And Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel&#8221;<\/strong>. I would rather have the Blood and the Word speak through and in me than from somewhere. My prayer for you is that you continue to abide in the True Vine and His Word will abide in you.

There is something about the blood circulating in human system that has to be protected by all means. We give out blood for other patient lives to be saved. The bible indicates clearly that the life of the flesh is in the blood and the life of the gospel is in the blood, and the life of every believer is in the blood and so we need to take the blood issue seriously.<\/p>\n<p>If you go back to <strong>John 15:5, &#8220;I am the Vine and you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without me you can do nothing&#8221;.<\/strong> If we are ever to allow blood to continue to circulate and stay alive and well, we got to be connected to the source of life which is Jesus Christ. <strong>John 14:6, &#8220;Jesus said to him, &#8220;I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me&#8221;. <\/strong>The only way we can get to the Father is by being connected to the Son. I think that one of the things that make it hard for us at times, is being able to distinguish between who the Vine is and who the branches are. I&#8217;m not surprised for I have seen people reverse the order and they acted as though they were the Vine and Jesus was the branch and by this I mean that everything someone did, they thought they were doing the Lord a favor when in the actual sense, He is doing us a favor.<\/p>\n<p>Listen to this, the bleeding believer is one who decides to be disconnected from the true Vine. For example, if you cut someone&#8217;s hand, that hand will die and rot but the entire body will still live though in pain. <strong>John 15:4, &#8220;&#8230; As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the Vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me&#8221;. <\/strong>You detach yourself from the Lord you will bleed to death meaning spiritually die. If you detach a hand from the body yes it will still look like it&#8217;s living and kicking but give it some more time as it looses blood and you will see it die, no more life let in it. We got to stay attached to the Vine everyday. No moving forward without being attached to the Vine and to be honest with you, it&#8217;s not easy staying attached to the Vine. You can not have the fruit of the Spirit recorded in the bible (love, patience, kindness, meekness, long suffering etc) without being attached to the Vine, Don&#8217;t you understand that <strong>Christ in you the hope of glory???<\/strong> without Him we can do absolutely nothing?.<\/p>\n<p>The bleeding believer cannot retain anything for they are bleeding daily, you pour strength into them, tomorrow they are weak again; you encourage them today, they will be discouraged tomorrow; you tell them you love them, they don&#8217;t feel loved enough; you speak destiny in their lives, they see themselves as failures, why? because everything you pour into their lives bleeds out. In as much as someone might encourage and strengthen you as long as you are bleeding, you will never retain for long. If you are the one to lift up a bleeding believer, if you see them the next day and the day after come to you with the same issue, they must be bleeding.<\/p>\n<p>With God where there is a problem, He has provided a way out. Ask yourself the first question, are you detaching yourself from the True Vine? you could be attached to a vine but not the true one and in the process of being detached from the wrong one, you will bleed but the good news is, you can be grafted onto the True Vine. Ask yourself why you cannot hold that which is poured into you, is it because of sin?, wounded by someone?, offended, broken?. Bind up the bleeding wounds, purpose in your heart to stop the bleeding in you. Phil <strong>2:12, &#8220;&#8230;work out your own salvation with fear and trembling&#8221;. <\/strong>No one can work your salvation for you. You have to do it yourself, you have to desire to live and do everything by all means to stop yourself from bleeding to death and let someone come and help you bind up the wound. Remember the woman with the issue of blood, she was bleeding too and she purposed in her heart to work out her own salvation by looking for and to Jesus and speaking to herself <strong><u>&#8220;If I may but touch the hem of His garment, I know I will be made whole&#8221;.<\/u> <\/strong>And the moment she touched His garment, she got attached to the True Vine and her bleeding stopped.

One of the things that has helped me grow in Christ in the last few years is reaching out to the lost on the streets.

As He was praying in the final hours, He was sweating blood. Then we see blood again when they whipped him on the whipping post, then when they forced a crown of thorn on His head, when they nailed Him on the cross and when the Roman soldier pierced Him on the side. I have seen that if someone has a cut, the first thing they try to do is prevent the cut from bleeding by all means for there have been people who bled to death. Jesus on the other hand was bleeding from being beaten with a whip, bleeding from the crown of thorn forced onto His head, bleeding after being nailed on the cross and bleeding from being pierced on His side. This is my theory, &#8220;the more He bled His precious blood, the more He was loosing His strength and being that He was also exhausted emotionally, physically, mentally carrying all the weight of sin of every man on His back, He still couldn&#8217;t die until His hour had come. <strong>It&#8217;s very clear to us that the life of the flesh is in the blood.<\/strong> For one to live, he or she has to have blood flowing in them. <\/span><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><u><strong>Jesus became what He was not that we might become what we were not.<\/strong><br \/><\/u><br \/>With that said, the blood that was shed on the cross was for us lost souls bought with the highest price.

We can now live, grow, bear fruit, stand, overcome because we are tied (abiding) in Him because without Him we can do nothing.

At one point they could take it because it was bearable, they hoped and prayed it would get better. Believe me, I have talked to people especially Christians who have been mistreated to the point of thinking of quitting. Lets see if the Lord takes notice of the victims of mistreatment.. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\"><strong>Vs 7, &#8220;The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert&#8230;vs. 8, And he said, &#8220;Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?&#8221;. <\/strong>This verse is an encouragement, right in the midst of discouragement, quitting and running a way, an Angel of the Lord visits just at the right time. I don&#8217;t know whether she ever had an experience where someone came to her rescue but here comes an Angel. Abram could not defend her, he couldn\u2019t even intervene when his wife Sarai was mistreating Hagar. Don&#8217;t you love it when you are going through something that causes you to run away and then here comes the angel and not just any angel but the Angel of God (often identified in the old testament as the pre-incarnate Christ)? The Angel did not refer to Hagar as Abram&#8217;s wife, He referred to her as Sarai&#8217;s servant in other words, he is reminding her of her days of humble beginnings, what she had missed. Jesus said, Mark 9:35, &#8220;<strong>&#8230;If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.<\/strong>&#8221; Pride or ego might have come in but just like Jesus said, <strong>&#8220;be a servant of all<\/strong>&#8220;. She was also being reminded of the order of things. Sarai was her leader in this sense. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">You would think the angel would say, &#8220;wait here I will put in a good word for you or deal with Sarai&#8221;, but what did the angel say to her, <strong>vs. 9&#8243;&#8230;&#8221;God back to your mistress and SUBMIT to her&#8221;. <\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">This is a word that is hard to deal with because it requires humility for I know not anyone who can bend if they are not humble. Hagar was told to RETURN and SUBMIT. Some situations are not meant to be ran away from, you just need to learn to rearrange the order of things. A good reason to trace back the roots that led to the current situation. You do an evaluation to understand the cause. <u><strong>You can try and run a way from it but the key to your release depends on whether you are willing to deal with submission. <\/strong><\/u>It is hard to submit when you feel or know you have more than the person you should submit to or more right. Hagar is young, has more attention now and she is expecting a son (highly valued), why should she submit? <strong><u>Her blessing will come from yielding and surrendering to Sarai&#8217;s authority. There can be no submission without humility. <\/u>How can one bow if they are not humbled? <\/strong>As I have said in the past, <strong><u>&#8220;HUMILITY IS NOT A SIGN OF WEAKNESS, IT\u2019S STRENGTH UNDER CONTROL&#8221;<\/u><\/strong>. Jesus humbled Himself and became obedient even unto the death of the cross. Was He weak? of course not, He said, &#8220;<strong>No man takes my life, I lay it down<\/strong>&#8220;, <strong><u>IT\u2019S A CHOICE NOT A CONDITION. <\/u><\/strong>He bowed because He was humbled and after it was said and done, He received the crown, dominion and a sit at the right hand of God the Father. The bible says, \u201cGod exalted Jesus and gave Him a name above all names that at the mention of the name Jesus, every knee should bow and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. In Hagar\u2019s case, her humility would choke life out of her pride and arrogance that was within her. Do you see again that the situation (fire) brought out the viper within? She had an opportunity to through it back into the fire as the Angel of the Lord helped her deal with it and God blessed her more after? To finish.

In Acts 28:3, while Paul was gathering sticks for fire to keep them warm, a viper came out because of heat, and fastened around on his hands. That is what the situations out of the ordinary do, they are like fire that generates heat causing the vipers inside of us to jump out and fasten on us. Paul saw the viper fastened around his wrist and dealt with the situation, threw it back into the fire to be consumed.<\/p>\n<p>This is the same way the Lord deals with us, at times He allows fire to come that the viper in us may jump out then we have an opportunity to deal with it, throw it back into the fire that viper for Him to consume it. This is where we cast our cares (our shortcomings) to the Lord and we say Lord consume what You have revealed. I don&#8217;t know about you but I thank God for some of those situations that reveal the junk in my life I need to deal with. Some situations push it to the surface leaving you with an option to either embrace it or deal with it.<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 16 tells us of a situation that revealed what was inside. Sarai and Hagar might have not known about it but it was always there. Abram (Abraham) is old so is Sarai (Sarah) but they have no child. Sarai has a maid that has been loyal to her all these years, she is beneath her and everything looks ok and peaceful. Sarai comes up with an idea she will later regret and that is to give Abram Hagar to wife so that Sarai would obtain children by her. All attention had always been given to Sarai but with Hagar present as a wife not a maid servant, brought a divided attention. After some time, Hagar conceives and the problem begins. <strong>Hagar began to despise Sarai.<\/strong> Remember any person whom you might have helped climb the ladder of success in an area and once they got up there, they began to despise you regarding you as unworthy. Cared less for you and more so tried to frustrate you? Or has someone helped you get up there and you began to despise them, forgot about them, tried to make their lives miserable? It happens and I have seen it so many times even in the Christian circle. Hagar might have not known that the despising spirit was in her until a situation like this brought that viper out. Someone said &#8220;<strong>Be good to people on your way up the ladder cause you will meet them on your way down<\/strong>&#8220;. The bible says, &#8220;<strong>Do not despise the days of humble beginnings&#8221; (paraphrased).<\/strong> Remembering small beginnings should humble you not to despise those who have not made far as you have.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Genesis 16:5, &#8220;Then Sarai said to Abram, &#8220;You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me&#8221;(NIV).<\/strong> Sarai on the other hand is battling with jealousy because Abram was going to have a son with Hagar. Who would he want to spend more time with Sarai who is old and childless or Hagar who I believe was young and was going to have a baby? That might have been Sarai\u2019s thought, not getting all the attention she used to get and what was harbored inside is revealed through this situation I would call fire. Have you ever helped someone climb the ladder then you had a problem with it later? They were prospering and you were still in the same place they left you? You used to get all the attention, now it has shifted. The thought of it is killing you inside. <strong>Sarai began to mistreat Hagar<\/strong>. She may have not known that she had the spirit of mistreatment inside her until a situation arose. Here is another thing that was revealed, Sarai shifting blame to Abram, &#8220;<strong>You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering<\/strong>&#8220;. Instead of taking part of the responsibility of advising, she throws all the blame on Abram. I would blame Abram too cause as the priest of his own home, there are certain decisions that he should have made to avoid all these but I just want to concentrate on these two women. One is despising, the other one is mistreating. Sounds very familiar but I thank God for them. The Lord searches the heart and tries the mind and if there is a root not of Him inside of us, little fire will cause them to jump out and fasten around our lives and that is good, like Paul when it\u2019s revealed, let\u2019s cast them upon the Lord that He may consume them. He is a consuming fire remember that. I will share more.

The more you live, the more you discover what is in you that is the work of God\u2019s righteousness. You don&#8217;t have to live with yourself long before you see undealt with flaws you never thought or imagined to have within you. I was talking to a friend about how people can change. People you never imagined could plan mischief against you are very much available and ready. This is life and if we never learn how to deal with some of these things, we will always live a defeated life trying to fit in with people, trying to please everyone only to find that you can only do so much. You will still find that there are people who don&#8217;t like you and your blessing and some change for reasons unknown to us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vs 1, &#8220;And it came to pass after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard<\/strong>&#8221; We have King Ahab who had power and thing? I don\u2019t know what u meant here. He was married to one of the most wicked women that ever lived, Jezebel who had power over him for some unknown reason. She had a way of running his life according to their story. Ahab was the type of king who was not satisfied with what he already had. He wanted to acquire more and more from even the people who did not have much. Naboth was a nobody compared to Ahab and had nothing apart from Vineyard. Vineyard is a plantation of vines producing grapes. Even though Ahab was the king, he was aware of his boundaries of what he could and could not do therefore he requested to purchase Naboth&#8217;s land for a price but Naboth refused to sell his land. I am yet to meet someone who says they have acquired enough therefore they don&#8217;t need more. People can be driven by jealousy to desire what already belongs to others, hoping that they will step away from it so that they can have it. Pressure can be put on people to abandon what they have simply because the other person does not want them around or want what they already have. begin to make progress and see if everyone will be pleased.<\/p>\n<p>Ahab could not take what did not belong to him by force, this saddened him but then Jezebel, his wife showed up to encourage him to go against his conscious. I am troubled by people who encourage others to do wrong things coating it with good words to make it sound not too bad. Trying to influence others to go against you because they don&#8217;t want to see you progress. <strong>Vs 7, &#8220;Then Jezebel his wife said to him, &#8220;You now exercise authority over Israel<\/strong>&#8220;, We need to be very careful about who speaks into our lives and encourages us to do certain things, a good reason for discernment. The people who tend to say some of these things are not from the outer circles but the inner circles just like Jezebel. Pushed by pressure to do something was a wrong move. First mistake, Ahab did was to receive wrong advise and he took it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>vs. 8. &#8220;And she wrote letters in Ahab&#8217;s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who were dwelling in the city with Naboth<\/strong>&#8220;, second mistake, allowing Jezebel to do everything in his name. Though he is not doing them directly, he is involved directly. If I can&#8217;t do my dirty work, I will have someone do it for me. If I can&#8217;t get what I want, I will show my pity to someone else that they step in and help me get it. vs. 13, &#8220;&#8230;<strong>and the scoundrels witnessed against him, against Naboth, in the presence of people, saying, &#8220;Naboth has blasphemed God and the King<\/strong>&#8220;, third mistake, lied on Naboth. <strong>vs. 13, &#8220;&#8230;Then they took him outside the city and stoned him with stones, so that he died<\/strong>&#8220;, fourth mistake, killed Naboth. Something that started very innocently has escalated to greater evil. What amazes me is that Ahab was watching all these knowing they were wrong yet said nothing because he supported it. After Naboth had been killed, he matches in and takes the vineyard but God had something to say about it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1Kings 21:20, &#8220;And he answered, &#8220;I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord&#8221;.<\/strong> You give the enemy a room, he will want the whole house. Ahab sold himself to do evil through his wife who gave him wrong advise. He yielded to that voice and allowed her to take advantage of the situation. God does not send a message to Jezebel who did all the work why? I believe Ahab had the power to do right and resist evil but he did not. Do you rejoice with those who are blessed or would you rather see them down, lie about them and speak about them to other people? Are you harboring hatred for them or jealousy over what they have and wishing it was yours? would you rejoice if they failed?

These things He has mentioned them in His word. We know for sure that He is a jealous God, He will not share His glory with anyone or with any creature. Over and over again He distinguishes Himself from any other being and allows us to see His uniqueness and His connection to us. I have learnt that if God is going to use anyone, he is using that person to make Him look good before men. I will explain what that means.<\/p>\n<p>A man in the bible blesses my heart for he depicts Christ&#8217;s position and his position. John the Baptist understood that he had come to prepare the way. When asked if he was the Christ, he responded that he was not. On one occasion he says, &#8220;<strong>There comes another one who is mightier than I, whom His shoes I&#8217;m unworthy to untie, He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire<\/strong>&#8221; <strong>paraphrased<\/strong>). This is a man making Christ look good before other people by magnifying the Lord. And when He saw Jesus coming, he said, &#8220;<strong>Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world<\/strong>&#8220;. Some of John&#8217;s disciples tried to exalt him when they heard that Jesus was baptizing when in the actual sense He only baptized His disciples. John&#8217;s disciples were concerned that Jesus was doing what John was suppose to be doing and this was his response, <strong>John 3:27, &#8220;&#8230;A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven&#8221;.<\/strong> Christ was operating in His authority and John&#8217;s job was to prepare the way for His coming. In my early years of ministry, I was given an opportunity in occasions to prepare the way for the Lord. But as time went by, anything that was suppose to bring glory to God, I took it because I allowed pride and people to exalt me by thanking me. Tempting opportunities came by to glorify myself and I did. It wasn&#8217;t long before I realized that what belongs to God if not handled well, He takes it away and places it in someone else who will acknowledge Him. John responded <strong>John 3:30, &#8220;He must increase, but I must decrease<\/strong>&#8220;. This man understood that everything that was happening in his life was to allow Christ to increase while he decreased. <strong>1Peter 5:6, &#8220;Humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due season<\/strong>&#8220;, When John humbled himself, did Christ exalt him in due season? yes He did, <strong>Mathew 11:11, &#8220;Assuredly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist<\/strong>&#8220;<\/p>\n<p>In the last few years that God broke me and molded me, He has taught me so many things about Him looking good before men. The more I have decreased, the more He has increased in my life. The more I have acknowledged what He has done through me, the more He has trusted me with His anointing and revelations. For those who know me, they know that all appreciations that come my way I give back to God for I am just but a vessel. I have preached many times and people were blessed, they thanked me but I directed it back to God. I refuse to take what belongs to God, that is his praises. <strong>Exodus 20:3, &#8220;You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes the name in vain<\/strong>&#8220;. This is the third commandment out of the ten. At first I thought this only meant that if you employed the name of the Lord as a curse word then you have taken His name in vain but I would submit that there is more to it than that. Failing to honor and praise His name is taking His name in vain, failing to thank God for what He has done is taking His name in vain and so is failing to point people to Him who has all the answers to their problems. He loves to hear His name given Honor. You fail to even testify for what He has done, is taking His name in vain because God does not just bless us so that we can be blessed, He blesses us so that we can testify before men of His blessings that they in turn may put their trust in God.<\/p>\n<p>Everything that the Lord is doing in each of us to bring glory to His name, you take any of His glory or failing to give glory to His name could mean lifting it off you and placing it in someone else who will do it. When you have humbled yourself to the point where you know that it&#8217;s not about you but about Him, nothing will stop you from giving Him glory due to Him. Someone sang a song to the Lord with these words, &#8220;<strong>Praises looks good on You<\/strong>&#8220;. I&#8217;m going to make sure that praise looks good on Him, if He uses me, when it&#8217;s been said and done and people have been blessed, I will give Him back the glory. There will be people who will thank me for the word, but I will direct that thanksgiving back to Him. If He says in <strong>John 15:5, &#8220;&#8230;for without Me you can do nothing<\/strong>&#8220;, this humbles me to know that any and every good thing that I am doing, He is behind it. The book of Esther did not mention the name of the Lord even once but we could see the Lord&#8217;s hand in every good thing that happened. I am constantly humbled to the fact He could pick me up and use me, what more can I do but make Him look good before men who are saved and who are not. He is good and always will but I will still make Him look good for praises looks good on Him.

This fellowship always sent a team to the missions field to preach the gospel. In happened that one day as the team was coming back from missions, they had an accident and some lives were lost. It was hard with the fact that they had just come from a weekend of victory. In this particular team, there was a gentleman called Simon, his fianc\u00e9e and his brother. Simon lost both his brother and fianc\u00e9e people found it hard to go to his hospital bed and break the news to him about the death of his fianc\u00e9e and brother. But when they gathered courage to break the sad news expecting the news to crush him, he said something that up to day still speaks to my heart. He said, &#8220;<strong>We don&#8217;t praise God for what He does for us (blessings), WE PRAISE HIM FOR WHO HE IS<\/strong>&#8220;. Is this something or what? Let me repeat it, <strong>We don&#8217;t praise God for what He does for us (blessings), WE PRAISE HIM FOR WHO HE IS<\/strong>&#8220;. Our primary reason for praising God is for who He is.<\/p>\n<p>I came across a song yesterday, the lyrics had the many blessings the Lord had done for the song writer then he concludes with this line, &#8220;that is the reason I praise Him&#8221;, does this mean that if the blessings of the Lord were missing, there would be no praise?, David opens Psalm 34:1, with a declaration, &#8220;<strong>I will bless the Lord at ALL times, His Praise SHALL continually be in my mouth<\/strong>&#8220;, if you know the story of David, David had one of the most hard times in life as a shepherd boy, as a king without a throne and as a king with a throne. You would expect David to only speak those words with all going well for him but that is not the case. When He spoke this Psalm, it was a time David pretended madness before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. Right in the midst of it all he made a declaration to bless the Lord at all times in every situation and persuaded himself to continually praise in his mouth.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to want to curse God than bless God in bad times. When we learn the main reason we praise God, we can pick ourselves up even in tough times and bless the Lord anyway for it&#8217;s not about us but about Him. Everything happens to His glory whether we believe it or not. Of course no one wants to go through bad times (I would a void it if I can) but can I stand to bless Him anyway?<\/p>\n<p>To strengthen his attitude, he says &#8220;<strong>My soul shall make its boast in the Lord\u2026&#8221;,<\/strong> this makes the devil so mad and confused because he is expecting us to be broken and miserable and perhaps curse God, instead, we brag in and on the Lord. Job was presented with the opportunity to curse God in his hard times but he would not <strong>Job 1:21, &#8220;And he said: \u201c Naked I came from my mother\u2019s womb, And naked shall I return there. <u>The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; Blessed be the name of the LORD.&#8221;<br \/><\/u><\/strong><br \/>One thing I believe these men Simon, David, and Job would not speak these boldly by themselves, the moment they declared to speak those words of praise, is the same moment God gave them grace and strength to endure and brought them out of their situations. <strong>Psalm 34:19, says, &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, But the LORD delivers him out of them all&#8221;. <\/strong><br \/><strong><br \/><\/strong>Lord help us to praise You for Who You are.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morningPsalm 34:1, &#8221; I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth 2 My soul shall make its boast in the LORD; &#8230;&#8221;There was a fellowship my parents would go to in the early 90&#8217;s, by then I was not saved.

By righteousness I mean the hunger to be made right. It\u2019s the righteousness of God through Christ that saves. We will enter into heaven not because we are good guys but because we are bad guys who Christ has made right by His righteousness. And those who don&#8217;t think they are hungry will not thirst to be filled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">If the unsaved are not hungering to be made right, what will create that hunger and thirst like the one the prison keeper had when he said, \u201csirs, what must I do to be saved? The key is in Matthew 5:13, where Jesus said, \u201cYou are the salt of the earth; &#8230;? &#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">We are the salt of the earth Jesus says, but what does that mean? Salt does a lot of things and one of the things salt does is that, IT CREATES THIRST. When we share with the lost about sin, judgment, God\u2019s righteousness, His holiness, hell, heaven, all we are doing is sharing God&#8217;s word that creates hunger and thirst and the more we share the more they become thirsty. The word drives away false hope leaving them hungry and thirsty for righteousness with an out loud cry, \u201cthen what must I do to be filled (saved)\u201d and like Jesus in John 4, give water of salvation that satisfies the thirst the law demands (righteousness) and the unsaved never thirst again to be made right because the thirst has been satisfied through the righteousness of God. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">As salt, we must go out to the highway and the byways and speak to the lost, give them something that will cause them to hunger and thirst for righteousness where they cry, &#8220;what then must I do to be saved&#8221;, then give them God&#8217;s means of salvation, Jesus Christ. I have seen that they are not coming, so I am going to them because Jesus said so.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:trebuchet ms;\">Thanks<br \/>Evans<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Matthew 5:6, \u201cBlessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled\u201d When I step out to witness to the lost, I usually learn a thing or two about the lost.

Naomi went to Moab a land where she couldn&#8217;t fit in and Ruth is now heading to a land where she does fit in. Both of them cannot go back to the past for they can&#8217;t fit in it anymore. Coming to the present, at one time they could fit in but with the new developments, they don&#8217;t fit in their present situation. They embark on a journey to find a place to fit it in. They have been told that Bethlehem has been remembered by God and God has graciously provided for His people but the question is, will these two women fit in?

She is looking at herself as a failure but her and Ruth were welcomed and embraced regardless of where they had been. People did not care about her history, they cared about her for who she is and has always been. Even through all the afflictions, later you will hear of how she maintained her integrity. Through her life style, she builds another life by the name of Ruth who in turn is spoken highly of for she had one of the best characters anyone could ever admire.

Da 1:20 In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom. Daniel 1:17 &#8211; 20<\/p>\n<p>Previously we looked at the true desire that Daniel and his friends had in their hearts and how they manifested that desire in their request to eat vegetables instead of indulging in the King&#8217;s meat. Though in the ungodly land of Babylon, they refused to be infested by it influence. Instead the Lord Himself was their influence, which was evident as He placed within them the knowledge, and skill, in all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. God equipped these men to be the best of the best, the cream of the crop. Proverbs 9:10 shows us why this was so as it reads, &#8220;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>These men certainly displayed this, once again in their prior actions of their food choice. Only these four would manifest the wisdom and knowledge that was matchless in light of the spiritual advisory board of Nebuchadnezzar full of astrologers, soothsayers, and sorcerers. The ungodly would not stand up to the godly. King Nebuchadnezzar summed the four Hebrews into his chambers and communed with them finding them to be ten times better then all the magicians and astrologers that were in his realm. Because these faithful Hebrews communed with the King of Kings and had the fear of the Lord in their lives, directing their motives, thoughts, and actions, they could not help but to out shine all the others. God showed that His chosen ones were truly the best of the best. As a follower of Christ, I believe that God&#8217;s people should shine as the best of the best in this ungodly world (our Babylon). We should shine as the best parents, spouses, educators, businessmen, musicians, actors, artists, writers, journalists, and leaders of our class. By class I mean as the four Hebrews boys were the best among their group and so should we be the best among ours. And what is the reason we should be the best, but to bring glory to God.<\/p>\n<p>Mt 5:14 &#8220;You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.&#8221;&gt;<\/p>\n<p>We need to covet the fear of the Lord in our lives, in order to have the same spirit manifest that shown in the lives of our four Hebrew examples. They lived in a land against their will, but thrived with that environment anyway. Perhaps you have chosen your path or perhaps it seems you found yourself in it, or it was chosen for you against your will. Whatever your scenario may be, be one that cultivates the fear of God in your life, and live in the fear and therefore wisdom of the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Application: What kind of parent, spouse, employee, teacher, etc&#8230;are you?

Be blessed as you read, Ev.<\/p>\n<p>Scripture reference..John 4:7-12. We all know the story of the Woman at the well, or as the Bible refers to her as the Woman of Samaria. We have to understand the historical racial hatred and tensions between the Jews and the Samaritans (IIKings 17:21-41, Ezra 4).<\/p>\n<p>Traditionally, Jewish men did not speak in public to women, even their own wives. Women were not publicly taught the law. A women&#8217;s place in society was not one remotely close to our own, but Jesus never treated women in the expected ways of his culture. He talked with them and taught them, He expected and trusted them to be able to proclaim the good news.<\/p>\n<p>Lets get to know this woman. Twice this woman is called the &#8220;Samaritan Woman&#8221; or in other words a &#8220;woman of Samaria&#8221; John 4:7&amp;9. Twice she is labeled, Twice her nationality and her religion were emphasized. This woman much like alot of us was not a &#8220;well-to-do woman&#8221;, Women of influence and affluence did not draw water from wells in thos times.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is the hint of a disreputable life -&#8220;You have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband.&#8221; (John 4:18).<\/p>\n<p>John 4:4 says that Jesus &#8220;had to go through Samaria. Jews normally avoided contact with their Samaritan neighbors by traveling other and longer routes\/ What so compelled Jesus that he had to travel through Samaria? It looks to me like he intentionally sought this woman out, seeing she did not seek him. Jesus made a point on occasions to confront and single out people who had great needs, the woman with the issue of blood, Jairus, the ruler of the synagogue, whose daughter was deathly ill&#8230;etc. Was there a special need or pain in this woman&#8217;s life, is there one in yours?<\/p>\n<p>I have heard various preachers and teachers talk about the Samaritan woman&#8217;s morality. But, Somehow, I much prefer to identify this woman as a sinner. It gives me hope. Hope that God would meet me where I am at, seek me out, his lost sheep and restore me and fulfill what ever need I have. To identify this woman as a sinner is not to dent her pain, for most of the sinners I know, or have met including myself were in pain of some kind. Whether or not from sinning or being sinned against there was pain.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus not only spoke to this woman and initiated a conversation but he asked her for a drink of water. He very deliberately chose to affirm life instead of hide bound tradition that said this woman was not only immoral but ritually unclean. I had to look at myself and ask myself, in what ways do I insist on honoring tradition thus neglecting to bring life to others.<\/p>\n<p>John 4:13-15. In these verses Jesus explains to the woman about the differences in the waters of the well and the living water. Stating that &#8220;Whosoever shall drink of this (well) water shall thirst again. But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him, a well of water springing up into ever lasting life? The woman said unto him, Sir give me this water that I thirst not&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The well represents Jesus, and the water represents what ever need I may have if you are not saved, it first represents the Holy Spirit. All I need in is Him. In Him I move, I live and have my being. The woman brought her empty jar to the well to be filled. She also brought her empty self, little suspecting that she too would be filled that day.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus is inviting us to meet him at the well&#8230;..What brings you to the well?<\/p>\n<p><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, This was shared by one of our devotion team members a few years back.

The reason we need to be careful about what we plant in our lives &#8217;cause sooner or later, we will look back and see why it was good or bad to plant some things. Let me share briefly on three things I call CCD. These are CHOICES, CHANGES and DECISIONS. We are what we are because of the choices, changes and decisions we make.<\/p>\n<p>According to thesaurus, Choices are options, alternatives, selection, preference and pick. We can see that choices are not one thing or one plan, they are many things that give you and I a chance to pick from. Choosing is preferring one thing or a person to another. This is my theory, choices tend to start from the beginning where you choose what direction to take. The choices you and I make today will have the ability to affect our tomorrow. People choose based on the surrounding, situation, peers, the present and even more. Everyone has to make some type of choices in their lives, choosing who to marry, what kind of job you desire, what kind of house you want to live in etc<\/p>\n<p>Change is to alter, modify, vary, transform, revolutionize, adjust or amend. No one can say that they have no ability to change. There are two types of changes, the change that occurs in a person and the change a person can makes. &#8220;Change&#8221; is as vital as &#8220;choice&#8221; only that &#8220;change&#8221; allows you to improve a &#8220;choice&#8221; made. The change can be big or small but everyone can see it&#8217;s significance. Changing your community begins with changed inside out to put aside what you don&#8217;t normally do and begin to develop a mindset of desiring to do it anyway, making it better. The change is not suppose to make it worse but better. Couples ought to change inside to make their marriages better and then using their change inside to change, perfect, revolutionize their marriage. Anyone who is not desiring to change is not ready for progress.<\/p>\n<p>Last but not least, &#8220;Decisions&#8221;. Decisions sound like choices and it is, but I look at choice as the beginning before anything happens while decisions are made in the middle of something and now a mind has to be made up. Decisions is making judgment, assessing the situation and making a resolution to it.<\/p>\n<p>All these three have one thing in common, they improve. Paul writes to the Romans and he is giving them guidelines to help them exercise these three things. One, &#8220;Do not be conformed to this world&#8221;, meaning do not try and copy the life style of this world to effectively bring these three to life because the world has set it&#8217;s standard on how to view them. Second, &#8220;But be transformed by the renewing of your mind&#8221;, Choices, changes and decisions are not made on emotions as many do, they are based on clear minds. It&#8217;s easy to do things without thinking and it affects us in the long run, but when our minds are renewed, they become in tune with our hearts, and with that we are ready to progress. &#8220;That you may prove what is that good and acceptable&#8221;, the three has to be approved, for example, when the manufacturers make any thing, they are not quick to bring it to the market, they prove it, test it, asses it to make sure it works well. They do not just look at what it can do today, they look at how long it will last, can it be effective, will it serve the purpose and so is with Christians, we have to prove what is that good, but by whose standards? men&#8217;s or God&#8217;s? God&#8217;s standards are acceptable because it&#8217;s based on His perfect will.<\/p>\n<p>We can make Choices, Changes and Decisions based on what is proved to be good and acceptable and perfect will of God. What choices are you making today?, what changes have you purposed to make? what decisions do you have to make? Have you proved them to know that they are good and acceptable and are in line with His perfect will?

It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man&#8217;s work. 1Co 3:14 If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. 1Co 3:15 If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames. (1 Cor 3:12 &#8211; 15)<\/p>\n<p>I heard a message many years ago which focused on the saddest day in heaven that bears repeating. Although all true Christians will make it to heaven the Scriptures says that some will suffer loss; he himself being saved, but only as one escaping through the flames. What &#8220;loss&#8221; could someone suffer in heaven? What could cause any day in heaven to be a sad one for any believer? Paul is imploring us to live our lives with the end in mind in 1 Corinthians 3:12-15 as he shares the following thoughts:<\/p>\n<p>1. What are you made of? Notice that there are three materials mentioned which are cheap and temporal and there are three which are costly and eternal. Which are you made of? Does your life material, your character represent what anyone can find while taking a walk in the woods or what is rare, precious, and costly?<\/p>\n<p>2. There is a testing Day coming. Most people hate pop quizzes. Paul reminds us that the testing day of what we are truly made of is coming, and it should not be a surprise to us on that Day. While non-believers will be judged in righteousness, Christians will be judged on their works unto the Lord. Are you ready for such a Day? Paul reminds us of the urgency of being ready for this test on God&#8217;s calendar.<\/p>\n<p>3. The Fire Will Reveal All! What is the result when one burns up wood, hay, and straw? Ashes. However, what happens when gold, silver and precious stones are burned up? The dross (the impurities) surface until all that remains is the pure precious metal. It was the valuable metals and precious stones (Rev 21:18-21) that were used to adorn ancient temples. Are not we too the temple of God (1 Cor. 2:12)? The fire is not testing the quantity built rather the quality of what you are made of, and the fire won&#8217;t lie, but will reveal!<\/p>\n<p>4. Giving a worthy Gift to Christ. What do you desire to lie down at the feet of your Lord and Savior, ashes or precious metals? We only have this one life to live. This is why Christ Himself commands &#8220;But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven&#8230;For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&#8221; Will your face be shining in the precious metals you lay at Christ&#8217;s feet, or will your face be saddened in the ashes of temporal works?

Ev<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Therefore my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.&#8221; (1 Corinthians 15:58)<\/p>\n<p>In 1938 Orson Wells showed America the great power of the media with his &#8220;War of the Worlds&#8221; broadcast. His announcement convinced multitudes that Aliens from Mars were attacking New York and New Jersey. His compelling broadcast had scores of people shaken. Harlem in NYC was one of those places that were severely shaken. &#8220;The parlor churches in the Negro district, congregations of the smaller sects meeting on the ground floors of brownstone houses, took the &#8220;news&#8221; in stride as less faithful parishioners rushed in with it, seeking spiritual consolation. Evening services became &#8220;end of the world&#8221; prayer meetings in some (New York Times, Oct. 31, 1938.&#8221; (<\/font><a href=\"http:\/\/members.aol.com\/jeff1070\/wotw.html\"><u><font size=\"2\" color=\"#0000ff\">http:\/\/members.aol.com\/jeff1070\/wotw.html<\/font><\/u><\/a><font size=\"2\">) <\/font><font size=\"2\">The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:58 writes too of what perhaps sounds like a &#8220;War of the Worlds&#8221; type broadcast as he describes the rapture (the snatching up quickly) of the church at the sound of the trumpet. However God&#8217;s Word is not a science fiction broadcast but a true account of what happened &#8220;In the beginning,&#8221; and what will take place in the future. Therefore, as we, The Church wait for this Great Day, Paul doesn&#8217;t instruct us to run around like lunatics with a big sign reading &#8220;The end is near&#8221; while we scream &#8220;Repent while you still have time.&#8221; Paul rather gives sound down to earth applicable instruction of what the Body of Christ is to do as it waits for the return of Christ. He writes, &#8220;Therefore&#8221; hence because this is going to take place, &#8220;my beloved brethren&#8221; those that I love listen to me. Then he touches on three characteristics for believers to have in place as they actively wait for Christ&#8217;s return as they are as follows:<\/p>\n<p>1. Be steadfast. The Christian life is not a sprint but a marathon, as Solomon reminds us &#8220;The race is not to the swift&#8230; (Eccl. 9:11)&#8221; As believers we need to embrace and exhibit a stick-to-itiveness spirit, an attitude of perseverance. The word quit should not be in the vocabulary of a Christian as it pertains to following the Lord. Paul said &#8220;However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me.&#8221; Run the race and refuse to give up. When the going gets tough, and your spiritual leg muscles are weary wait on the Lord to renew your strength (Isa. 40:31)&#8221; and &#8220;&#8230;be strong the grace that is in Christ Jesus (2 Tim 2:1).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>2. [Be] Unmovable. Be stable. This world is a very unstable place that can&#8217;t ever seem to make up its mind. The Christian although living in the world is not of the world and therefore needs to show the world stability in Christ in their midst of the instability of this present world controlled by the god of this world (the devil).<\/p>\n<p>3. [Be] Always abounding in the work of the Lord. What do you do for the Lord? Are you a Sunday Morning Christian only? Most Christians don&#8217;t have the work of the Lord in their schedules because much of their work is for themselves or others. Paul employs that we abound in God&#8217;s Work. Whose work are you abounding in? Are you as efficient for God as you are for your employer? When you exhibit these godly characteristics you do it for the service of the King and therefore &#8220;your labor is not in vain in the Lord&#8221; as you are spurred to serve the Lover of your soul.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Due to unforeseen circumstances, I have not been able to deliver devotions for the last three days, my apologies.

The city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there.&#8221; This is what the LORD Almighty says: &#8220;It may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time, but will it seem marvelous to me?&#8221; declares the LORD Almighty.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Zechariah 8:4-5.<\/p>\n<p>When reading this verse what comes to mind? Perhaps for many may reminisce about your own childhood. As a child, I remember a neighbor sitting out on his deck often with his wife. I also recall playing on one particular dead end street where I formed many childhood friendships. It was great because there were only two houses on the street so traffic was not an issue. The sight of the aged sitting outside and children playing paints a vivid picture of tranquility and safety. Many seniors today are placed in nursing homes, and many children are not playing in the streets but are, as we say in New York City, &#8220;running the streets.&#8221; When will this picture become a reality? In the hit movie, The Lord of the Rings, the King returned to take his throne, and peace reigned in the land. When our King Jesus returns the picture painted by Zechariah will be an authentic one. When Christ returns, the prophet tells us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Wisdom is visible<\/p>\n<p><\/strong>The aged will sit in the streets, each with cane in hand. Proverbs 16:31 tells us, &#8220;Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained by a righteous life.&#8221; Many today are too busy to listen to the wisdom of the aged righteous. However at Christ&#8217;s return, I believe, there will be seniors sharing their wisdom to ears ready to listen. When the aged speak do you listen to their wisdom?<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Fun is visible<\/p>\n<p><\/strong>Children were depicted playing in the streets. Many of the streets nowadays are not as safe to play in. Kids are &#8220;running the streets,&#8221; getting into trouble, instead of playing. As children many of us laugh, play, dream, and have fun, but as adults we seem to let those things fade into the background, and fall by the wayside by the voice of &#8220;responsibility&#8221; and work, to which many follow its tune. Work and responsibilities never seem to end, but its time to laugh again, dream again, and yes even to play again. The old saying goes, &#8220;All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.&#8221; Keep the fun flowing in your life. When Christ returns kids will once again be able to play again and perhaps we will all be able to &#8220;be a kid again&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>ourselves.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Enjoyment is visible<\/p>\n<p><\/strong>With the aged sitting in the streets and children playing in the streets, life has peace, prosperity, and security. The prophet Isaiah shares similarly in 65:20 &#8220;Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years&#8230;&#8221; Praise the Lord, for this time that we have to look forward to of unhindered enjoyment with our Savior, and fellow believers. However there are plenty of things in our lives to enjoy now as we wait.<\/p>\n<p>During this Christmas season my nephew Antonio and I got to spend a few quality days together. We played together, laughed together, and even wrestled around in some Star Wars light saber battles. My five year old nephew &#8220;Tones&#8221; as we call him taught me a lot of things that I forget at times, and inspired this message. As we wait for our Savior, let us appropriate wisdom, fun, and enjoyment into our Christian lives, because in His presence is fullness of JOY!<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026<br \/>\nBlessings,<br \/>\nPastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;This is what the LORD Almighty says: &#8220;Once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with cane in hand because of his age.

The apostles were empowered with the fruit and the gifts of the Holy Spirit of God to fulfill the commission. They understood the commission to be the crowning philosophy given and was most likely to result from believers adhering to the other teachings given by Jesus. By the time readers get to Acts 15, readers have also witnessed wonderful and spectacular things that occurred under the superintendence of the Holy Spirit. Because the lives of the apostles represented an amazing similitude of the life of the Lord, the Spirit was able to bring about the plans and purposes of God in every nation on earth. Through the great commission, believers not only demonstrate their obedience to Christ, but they also join God by and through their efforts in deposing and eclipsing the decay initiated and promoted through sin and the works of the devil. No one can read the Acts narratives without clearly and convincingly observing this.<\/p>\n<p>When looking to Acts 15, world evangelism and missions were experiencing unparalleled success. Every device of the devil to curtail the momentum and the scope of the commission had been absolutely defeated. The devil could not by his outward strength oppose the strength mightily demonstrated by the unleashing of the Spirit through the lives of the apostles who were daily surrendering their lives to Him and closely adhering to the truths of Christ. The outward works were evidence of the inward surrender- and clearly, hell at its best had been undone! Amen?<\/p>\n<p>Until&#8230; Acts 15.<\/p>\n<p>Here, a dispute between the Greek and Hebrew ethnicities came to light.<\/p>\n<p>The issue involved the proper distribution of wealth and resources. One ethnicity had been clearly overlooked and was disproportionately disadvantaged. This issue was so serious that the humble disciples- now mighty apostles had to come off the front lines of the battlefield. They left the missions and returned home to settle the dispute. The internal strife touched the very heart of the life of the church- body of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>The apostles understood that if they failed at properly settling this dispute, they would show that they did not truly know the mind and heart of Christ concerning people, and the blessing of the Spirit would no longer continue with them.<\/p>\n<p>The apostles properly assessed the issue. The problem was that men of similar spiritual substance were not at the head of the project. The people were instructed to elect people with whom they were acquainted and could positively ascertain the depth of their commitment and submission to the things of God. Once these people were appointed to the task, the apostles were able to resume their commission. I find, arguably, that their wisdom and success in this instance further solidified and vindicated the claims of Christ, which continued the blessing of the Spirit so much so that it was observed in Acts 17 that the entire world was turned upside down!<\/p>\n<p><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, This message is forwarded by Pastor Phil, be blessed.

Humility will cause you to put your pride a side and say whatever it takes to deal with the offenses. In my life I don&#8217;t bow if I&#8217;m not humbled, I don&#8217;t laugh if it&#8217;s not funny and I don&#8217;t scratch where it&#8217;s not itching, something has to happen inside that causes you and I to do what we couldn&#8217;t do in the past because we have encountered with the Lord who humbled us. Seven is a number of completion or perfection, it&#8217;s known to be the number of God to which I could interpret that Jacob is coming in the name of the Lord of perfection. Genesis 33:4, &#8220;But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept&#8221;. Here comes Jacob ready to face his brother not knowing how, he is expecting the worse from the one he offended. Instead of justice, he is shown mercy. Esau reaches out and embraces him. He embraced him, a sign of breaking the barrier and he fell on his neck and kissed him as a sign of love and they wept together a sign of how they missed each other. Offenses caused took away many years of their lives they could have spent building, supporting, learning, loving each other.<\/p>\n<p>Who in the family have you disconnected from because of the offenses, how about friends and the church?. I believe in restoration and I know God will restore but you have to be willing, James 5:16, &#8220;Confess your faults one to another, pray for one another that you may be healed&#8230;&#8221;. Offenses will bring in you sickness that the only way to be healed will be by confessing your faults one to another, releasing people by saying I forgive you. The bible says, &#8220;Forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive&#8221;, God forgives us as we are in the process of forgiving.<\/p>\n<p>Jacob for the first time saw Esau differently and so did Esau, right temperature incubated forgiveness and mercy in both of them because Jacob had encountered with God, he was able to see his brother through the eyes of God. He tells Esau in Genesis 33:10, &#8220;&#8230;I have seen your face as though I have seen the face of God&#8221;. This line has just blown my mind in the sense that the way Esau treated him that day was the same way God dealt with him when he messed up. Watch this, some people will only see the face of God in you by how you approach and deal with the offenses. I pray that we God will install in each of us a thermostat that controls what comes out of us and He will build something in us that will cause us to propel love, mercy, forgiveness, repentance, joy, peace that we may deal with the offenses in away pleasing to God. May He sit on what the enemy wants to incubate.<\/p>\n<p>*Please keep my grandma in prayers, she has high blood pressure, hearing problem and loosing her sight. She is aging but still strong physically. She is a woman of God that I love and respect very much and my prayer is that God will reach out to her and heal her. I believe God has many more years for her to live and see the things she prayed to God unfolded.

Ev<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.&#8221; (2 Chronicles 7:14)<\/p>\n<p>Can you imagine what the Garden of Eden must have been like? Before sin entered into the world, all things were perfect. However, when we look at our land now, it can easily be seen how sin has left its ugly stain. In America there are 95% to 97% that profess to believe in God. Despite this belief abortion continues to rise, homosexuality and fornication increases, death and destruction appear to have no end in sight as the moral decay of the nation continues to spiral downward. What is God&#8217;s remedy to the problem of moral decay in a nation? It is not through politicians, it is not through new programs, manipulative speeches, education, or financial growth. God points out they He is looking to His people to repent! Why do God&#8217;s people need to repent?<\/p>\n<p>There is a lack of humility. &#8220;Shall humble themselves&#8221; Many of God&#8217;s people do not read His word, nor submit to it. God is calling for His people to humble themselves. Why because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble. If we don&#8217;t humble ourselves God will do it for us! Remember Jonah running away from his evangelistic responsibility, God humbled him. Will you humble yourself? God&#8217;s promise for those that humble themselves is that he will lift you up. In God&#8217;s economy God will resist the proud hearted and welcome the humble hearted. Perhaps that is why the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>There is a lack of pray &#8220;Humble themselves and pray&#8221; When God&#8217;s people don&#8217;t pray, what they are saying is that they don&#8217;t need God. One normally doesn&#8217;t talk to people one does not know, and the reverse is true. Recently a professing believer shared that he did not see the efficacy of prayer. Jesus prayed and He was the Son of God, the Apostles prayed and they walked with the Master, what is your excuse if you have a prayer less life?<\/p>\n<p>There is a lack of seeking God. &#8220;seek my face&#8221; I&#8217;ve heard it well said that many seek the hand of God but Jesus sought God&#8217;s face. Jesus sought His Father many early mornings, when everyone was sleeping, he was seeking. Mark writes, &#8220;Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place.&#8221; Jesus spoke with His Father. I picture that Jesus not only prayed, He listened to his Father&#8217;s voice, early in the morning, late at night, and sometimes all night he sought the Father. Like a thirsty traveler crawling through a desert seeking water, Jesus went alone to a solitary place. When one seeks God, one seeks His face, and upon seeing His face one seeks His will. Seeking God will result in seeking to do His will.<\/p>\n<p>There is a lack of seeking the lost &#8220;and turn from their wicked ways&#8221; What could be a more heinous crime for God&#8217;s people then to fail to warn the unsaved about Judgment Day and the horrors of Hell and then watch them go to Hell? Most of the church has taken a vow of silence and do not speak to lost people about the things of eternity, the truth of Jesus Christ. We must turn from our wicked ways.<\/p>\n<p>There is a Condition. then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.&#8221; There are two types of promises, once that is unconditional, and the other that is conditional. The IF&#8230;THEN&#8230;is the conditional one, which God speaks at the end of the above verse. If we humble ourselves, pray, seek His face, and turn from our wicked ways, then God will bestow forgiveness and healing upon our land. If we don&#8217;t do it, God will not grant forgiveness and healing.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<br \/>\nPastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n<p><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Before today&#8217;s message, I have been asked to share a gospel message tomorrow at a friend&#8217;s wedding, may I ask you to keep me in prayers for boldness, powerful message and that people&#8217;s hearts will be open to the gospel and convicted.

In wrestling there is winning and loosing, and here Jacob is wrestling with a Man who we know is God. The flesh and the Sprit wrestling each other. His flesh wanted to be control as he always did but where God was sending, only His was going to be in control. Another thing I see from him wrestling with God, Jacob encountered with a power he could not manipulate and he would not let go. Genesis 32:26, &#8220;&#8230;I will not let you go unless You bless me&#8221;. Remember that the first time he tricked his brother and took away his birthright, then took a way his blessing, in Laban&#8217;s home, he mixed animals to get the best but when he encounters with God, he cannot manipulate Him. Here is my thinking; he might have said in his heart, &#8220;I will not let you go till You have changed me inside out.<\/p>\n<p>I now understand that when I&#8217;m wrestling, there is war between the flesh and the Spirit and God is changing me then installs the thermostat to face all that I have been running from. Before God allows you to deal with the offenses, He will change you in and out but you got to be willing. Jacob realized that if God wasn&#8217;t going to help him, he couldn&#8217;t face his brother and his future was going to be in jeopardy too. He humbled himself, he prayed, he wrestled with God in readiness to meet his brother. Had God not worked on Joseph first, maybe meeting his brothers could have turned into revenge. When God works on us, we can face everything we&#8217;ve been running from. His right temperature of love and mercy will propel us to incubate the same to the people who have hurt us.<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 33:1, &#8220;Now Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and there was Esau coming and with him were four hundred men&#8230; vs. And he put the maid servants and their children in front, Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last&#8221;. Remember how Jacob wrestled with God and could not let Him go until He blessed him and so Jacob reports this in Genesis 32:30, &#8220;So Jacob called the name of the place Penile, &#8220;For I have seen God face to face, and my life is reserved&#8221;. There is something about seeing God face to face that causes us to change. Live with God longer and your life will be transformed, 1John 3:2, &#8220;Beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him for we shall see Him as He is&#8221;. The word &#8220;know&#8221; is an absolute statement and then the word says we shall see Him as He is and when we do, we shall be changed. The more you encounter with God the more you become like Him and the more you can deal with offenses differently. Jacob gets changed inside out and ready to meets his brother. The chapter I just mentioned when starting this paragraph troubled a bit. Jacob has been sending messengers to meet with his brother on his behalf, then comes a time that to meet him, he looks a head and there is Esau coming with four hundred men who look like warriors. He takes the maidservants and puts them in front followed by Leah and her children and finally Rachel and Joseph. Why in that order? The ones he cares for the most he puts them behind and the ones he cares for the least he puts them in front so that incase anything happens, Esau can kill them in the order of less cared for. Understand something, just because you encounter with God does not make you come back crying Holy for it&#8217;s a process of becoming like Him. You can see Jacob still has issues but thank God he is not who he used to be. He is sacred but running back, I call this fighting scared. Later in the same chapter, he lies to his brother but watch his life gets transformed over and over again. Some are frustrated right now because God did not take care of everything immediately, hey if He did everything all at once, it will be too much for you to handle.

And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison.&#8221;(Acts 12:5 -6)<\/p>\n<p>Times of adversity have a way of testing our faith. What do you do when adversity strikes? Do you run away, pray, complain, and become depressed? The gospel message that is preached by many at this time is this, &#8220;God has a wonderful plan for your life.&#8221;Is this the Gospel that Jesus preached? I don&#8217;t see this in the Scriptures. Jesus said in John 16:33 I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Let me give you some background about the verse above. James (one of the Apostles) was just beheaded. Herod saw this pleased the Jews so he locked Peter up in prison to do the same thing to Peter that he did to James, take his head off with a sword. Peter is sitting in prison, basically as far as he is concerned, on death row waiting to die. He doesn&#8217;t stay up all night worrying; he is not even trying to escape. What would you be doing at this point? Do you think that you would be doing what Peter was doing, SLEEPING?!?! This is truly faith in action. How can Peter sleep during a time that his life is about to be taken?<\/p>\n<p>1. Peter leaned faith from the Master. When the disciples were in the boat during the storm they were frantic, but Jesus was at rest sleeping. They woke up Jesus and said &#8216;Lord, save us! We&#8217;re going to drown!&#8221; He replied, &#8220;You of little faith, why are you so afraid?&#8221; Peter was no doubt experiencing this lesson which, unbeknown to him, he would need to apply while waiting to die in a prison cell. Who has shown you how to respond by faith during trouble?<\/p>\n<p>2. Peter applied the faith he learned. Peter was sleeping like a parishioner in the back row of a church. Peter&#8217;s faith was resting in Christ, because faith snoozes even in a storm. Stephen had already been stoned, and James beheaded, yet Peter slept in the cell, as Christ slept in the boat. Paul admonishes us to, &#8220;Be anxious for nothing&#8230;&#8221;Do you rest during times of trouble, or do you doubt, complain, worry, etc&#8230;?<\/p>\n<p>3. Peter&#8217;s faith surpassed understanding. I wonder what the guards that he was chained to, were thinking as Peter slept. I can imagine that Peter fell asleep first and then because Peter was being an inactive prisoner they fell asleep after him. Perhaps they said to each other, &#8220;how can this guy sleep when he is going to be headless tomorrow.&#8221;This is speculation of course. Peter was a man of prayer, and the church was also praying for him, which caused the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, to guard his heart and mind through Christ Jesus.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Do you experience this kind of peace amidst your trials? Do others see the peace of Christ in you during the storms of your life? Do you share your faith with others so they as they repent and put their faith in Christ they too will know how to rest in the midst of trouble. The unsaved are currently in the biggest trouble ever, awaiting Hell if they die without the Savior? What are you doing about it?<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<\/p>\n<p>Evans<\/p>\n<p><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;Peter was therefore kept in prison, but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church.

I believe in my heart that God is bringing restoration in the land, in the families, in marriages, in schools, in the jobs etc. What God is doing is a process and we as His people should be ready at any given moment of time to move when He says move. Jacob was living a foreign land and God decides to move him come back home, a place he had ran a way from. I am understanding that God wants to restore first the relationships that were broken before He can elevate. Is this not the same way God dealt with us, when we failed the test and no sacrifice could pave a way for us to relate to Him, then Jesus come down from heaven, wrapped Himself up in the flesh, died on the cross and paved a way for us to have that relationship that we lost when Adam sinned in the garden of Eden. Every other blessing is an after fact. Jacob is scared of going back to deal with the past and so is someone from our devotion team. It is crucial for God to restore broken relationships because where He wants to take us, we cannot bring baggage that will wear us out. Jacob recognized that God walked with Abraham (his grand father) and Isaac (his father) and God had promised to walk with Him back. Watch this, a part from the blessings he had in form of wives, children and possessions, He had a promise from God that everything will be fine. He did not know what the end result would be but all had was promise. We too have the same promise, Jesus said, &#8220;lo I am with you always&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 32:11, &#8220;Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother; from the hand of Esau; for I fear, lest he come and attack me and the mother with the children&#8221;. Do you see that for the offenses to be broken there has to be humility, a broken heart understanding that we&#8217;ve all failed. In as much as we needed mercy from God when we failed, someone needs our mercy when they fail us and we need their mercy when we fail them. Jacob is humble and calls first calls on God, then he realizes that if he is going to face the past, God has to help him deal with it. Something funny is that Jacob is trusting in God but at the same time he is also making plans on how to appease his brother. He has his plans and God has His own plans. He plans to give Esau presents to help compensate for what he did but just like God, He does not need sacrifices prepared by man, listen to what David says in Psalm 51:16&amp;17, &#8220;For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it; thou delightest not in burnt offering. vs. 17, the sacrifices of God are broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart&#8221;. Presents will not buy the way out, broken heart and a contrite spirit will. God is about to transform Jacob in a mighty way that as he is praying and waiting on God to move, he has nothing to do but try and come up with something that he thinks might work. If it&#8217;s not of God, it will not work!!<\/p>\n<p>If God is going to restore you, He has a lot of clean up to do in your life?. God does not want Jacob again to meet his brother and deal with things in the flesh like before and I know why. Already in the past he had messed up because his temperature had no thermostat and no one to control it. So I believe God retained him for sometime to install a thermostat and promise him that he will be in control. On the other hand, God is doing the same in the life of Esau who is not mentioned very much about his dealing with God but later we will see that God installed a thermostat in Him too and was controlling His destiny. God controls what we can handle through Him the reason we ought to thank God for installing a thermostat in us and controls it.

We defined who they are, their character and understanding that we too are from the same source but are different. Last night on TV they were talking about the famous murderers and I was thinking of how I&#8217;m no better than them because the bible says in Romans 3:23 &#8220;ALL HAVE SINNED AND FALL SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD&#8221;, Jeremiah 17:9, &#8220;THE HEART IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS AND DESPERATELY WICKED. In other words everything we can imagine is in us, I thank God for sitting on the worst things that could have manifested. No wonder the bible says, &#8220;Romans 3:10, As it is written: &#8221; There is none righteous (good), no, not one&#8221;, this humbles me.<\/p>\n<p>From my experience I have noticed that harbored things in the heart tend to surface and directed towards someone not so much because of who they are, but because of what they do.. As long as Abel had not won the attention of God through his sacrifice, Cain was okay but the moment Abel did that which was right before God, Cain had a problem with it. I saw this with Joseph and his brothers and so was the prodigal son and his older brother. Many are fuming with frustrations because they were not treated right or were ignored. People get offended so many times and mark this, offenses build fences. We need to understand that offenses will come cause we are living in a fallen world, Jesus knew of this and so He told us and the disciples in advance, Luke 17:1, &#8220;Then he said unto the disciples, it is impossible but that offenses will come&#8221;. Offenses is one of those junk in us and if boiled correctly, and gets incubated at the right temperature, be sure it will come out unless the Lord who controls the temperature has His hands on the thermostat. Esau is offended and you can see that he is angry, bitter, has hatred towards his brother and we see these things boiling inside ready to explode and the next move is that he is destined to kill his brother. How many do the same, they may not literally want to kill physically but they kill spiritually. Many have killed with the words because of the anger and hatred that was within. I usually say that if you really want to know someone, watch and see how they deal with frustrations, anger, bitterness, these things leave people to be disoriented unless the Lord is in control. I have met people who have disconnected themselves from their brothers and sisters because of the offenses, children who have disconnected themselves from their parents because of the offenses. People who have walked away from the church because of offenses, the bible says that offenses will come. Be ready for them at any time, and remember that you will not be the only one offended, people around you will and so will you also offend someone else. Constantly people look at what has been done to them and not what they have done to someone else. Offenses caused Esau and Jacob to be disconnected for a long time. Two boys who could have grown up together could not because a few episodes.<\/p>\n<p>I believe with all my heart that the enemy uses the offenses to bring divisions everywhere. Instead of us concentrating on fighting the enemy, we take on each other leaving the real enemy. Give the devil an inch, he will take the whole ruler and beat you with it!!.(as pastor Phil would say) . It is important to know your enemy. 2Corithians 10:3, &#8220;Though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh, vs. 5 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ&#8221;. People are flesh and blood and they are not the enemy, the enemy is what is inside that the devil is trying to boil at a right temperature to incubate it. Know who your enemy is otherwise you are bound to fight the wrong one. From my view I have come to understand that offenses most of the time are my own imaginations and my bible says cast them down. Offenses will take one&#8217;s mind from doing the right thing, bring every thought into captivity and under the obedience of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t stress enough, offenses will come, how we deal with them matter&#8217;s a lot. You can run from them but you will not be settled until you deal with them. Jacob ran to his uncles place but one day he had to come back and deal with it. I believe that God will not do greater things until He has restored. God did not really use Jacob greatly until He restored both Esau and Jacob by making them meet and reconcile.

If Christ did not die in our place we would forever be stained and saturated in our sin and transgression.<\/p>\n<p>Paul&#8217;s urging is for you and I to offer ourselves as an offering completely to the Lord and his service. Before a priest in Israel could minister on behalf of others, he was obliged to present himself in a consecrated condition and the sacrifices he offered were to be without blemish (Mal 1:8-13). The priest offered God a dead sacrifice, while we are called to be a living sacrifice. A living sacrifice can crawl off the altar of obedience. Again Samuel wrote, To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams&#8221; (1 Sam 15:22). We are to offer our lives, our whole lives to the Lord as an offering to Him. What else can we really offer to the One that founded the entire world? Let me close with this illustration.<\/p>\n<p>I recall a true story of a nine year old boy who lived in a rural town in Tennessee. His house was in a poor area of the community. A local church had a bus ministry that came knocking on his door one Saturday afternoon. The kid came to answer the door and greeted the bus pastor. The bus pastor asked the little boy if he and his parents ever went to church. The boy replied no. The bus pastor shared his faith with the young boy whose heart melted at the gospel story. The boy then went to church with the bus pastor. While at the church the little boy just sat there, clue-less of what was going on. A few minutes into the service these tall unhappy guys walked down to the front and picked up some wooden plates. One of the men prayed and the kid with utter fascination watched them walk up and down the aisles. He still didn&#8217;t know what was going on.<\/p>\n<p>All of a sudden like a bolt of lightning it hit the kid what was taking place. These people must be giving money to Jesus. He then reflected on the free gift of life he had received just twenty-four hours earlier. He immediately searched his pockets, front and back, and couldn&#8217;t find a thing to give Jesus. By this time the offering plate was being passed down his aisle with a broken heart he just grabbed the plate and held on to it. He finally let go and watched it pass on down the aisle.<\/p>\n<p>He turned around to see it passed down the aisle behind him. And then his eyes remained glued on the plate as it was passed back and forth, back and forth all the way to the rear of the sanctuary. Then he had an idea. This little nine year old boy, in front of God and everybody, got up out of his seat. He walked about eight rows back, grabbed the usher by the coat and asked to hold the plate one more time. Then he did the most astounding thing I have ever heard of. He took the plate, put it on the carpeted church floor and stepped into the center of it. As he stood there, he lifted his little head up and said, &#8220;Jesus, I don&#8217;t have anything to give you today, but just me. I give you me!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We are to become the offering unto the Lord through our obedience. When you offer yourself fully to the Lord in your time (the way you spend your time), talents (the manner that you use the gifts God bestowed upon you), and treasures (your finances and material blessings), you become the living sacrifice that God desires of you. How are you spending you time; does your schedule reflect His Lordship? How do you use your talents for Him, the ones that He has given you? Does your check book, credit card statement, and spending, reflect that Jesus Christ is Lord of you? May you be an offering worth offering unto the One you call Lord.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God&#8217;s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God-this is your spiritual act of worship.&#8221; (Rom 12:1) The ultimate offering is when Jesus Christ sacrificed His life on the cross to pay the penalty for our sin(s). 1 Peter 3:18 [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-564","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-96","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/564","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=564"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/564\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=564"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=564"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=564"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":563,"date":"2006-10-19T08:45:20","date_gmt":"2006-10-19T08:45:20","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/10\/19\/right-temperature-incubated-it-part-1\/"},"modified":"2006-10-20T08:49:21","modified_gmt":"2006-10-20T08:49:21","slug":"right-temperature-incubated-it-part-1","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/10\/19\/right-temperature-incubated-it-part-1\/","title":{"rendered":"Right Temperature Incubated it, Part&nbsp;1"},"content":{"rendered":"<p style=\"margin:0;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 33:4, &#8220;But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There is a cause for everything, when you look at the end result, you can trace back it&#8217;s origin. For creation, we can trace back to know there is a creator God, for the things made, you can trace them back to the manufacturer. I think that things don&#8217;t just happen, this is my opinion!!!!. Today when you are sick and you go to the doctor, what happens, they begin to ask you about your family history. &#8220;Did your grandma have kidney problems or heart disease?&#8221; or whatever the doctors will ask you. This tries to help them trace the origin. Every tree has the roots and the roots determine how strong the tree can be and how much it can produce. Shallow roots will cause the tree not to be resistant to heavy winds and water that washes the tree away. Once again, every problem has it&#8217;s roots and in as much as we can try and fix the branches and the fruits, dealing with the root will open doors for healing and restoration.<\/p>\n<p>Esau and Jacob have one of the most powerful stories in the bible and one of the most disturbing stories too. We know that these two are twins, whether identical or not I don&#8217;t know but all I know is that they are twins. Esau is older than Jacob and in as much as during that time women could have as many children as they could, Rebekah only gave Isaac two sons. From my experience, twins tend to get a long very well maybe up to a certain stage in their lives. Even identical twins have some things in their lives that make them unique and the bible takes the time to define each boy&#8217;s uniqueness. Esau is a hunter and Jacob appears to be the mama&#8217;s boy, Esau is well built and hairy, Jacob is smooth and skinny, Esau is tough and careless and Jacob is cunning and manipulative. Two boys, twins but are different in things pertaining life. We too came from the same source but very different. Some things we were never born with but for some unknown reasons we have them. Certain things no one taught us but they are in our system. No one can really go back and say that on such and such a day, I took a course in lying or stealing. No one can say that they graduated with a degree in anger and frustrations at a given time. Therefore how come we have so many things we were never born with? In the fallen world we live in, already we failed the test the first day we took the class and that is the day we were born. Every junk that you could ever think about was already in each of us and some of the things were waiting for the right time to be incubated before we saw the results. Some of them did not manifest because there was no such great temperatures to incubate it.<\/p>\n<p>We are all glad that some things did not incubate in our lives to bring the worse out of us. When we understand our own limitations and realize that everyone around us is as bad as we are, we begin to look at things differently. Just because someone&#8217;s hidden things came out at a certain time does not mean that it&#8217;s not in us. We are just glad that God prevented them from showing up. I thank God for the blood, not only did the blood take care of what I did, but it also took care of what I could have done and what I could have been. I know many thank God for cleansing them of the past sins but think about it, do you know who you could have turned out to be if the blood did not also take care of what you could have done? I don&#8217;t want to even imagine what my end result could have been if God did not show up in my life.<\/p>\n<p>To get back to Esau and Jacob there is something about Genesis 27. Isaac was old and almost dying, he has a chance to bless one of his sons and the right candidate becomes the first born as it was in the olden days. Isaac gives his son Esau instructions as what to do before being blessed. Rebekah hears all the instructions and wants to help her little boy Jacob get the blessing instead of Esau. Remember that every thing that you could think about is in both boys, one is about to be incubated at a very high temperature. Esau is busy in the field trying to please his father on the other hand his brother is out to steal his opportunity of being blessed. \u00a0Plan is well orchestrated in the absence of Esau and it does not come to his mind that there is something being planned behind his back that has to be done real quick before his return.<\/p>\n<p>This is ground work for message. Today&#8217;s introduction will lead us to talk about anger, bitterness, distress, offences and even resentments, some of the major killers even in the church today. Understanding ourselves better will help us deal with issues that has brought divisions, have torn families and churches apart.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 33:4, &#8220;But Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept&#8221; There is a cause for everything, when you look at the end result, you can trace back it&#8217;s origin.

I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.&#8221; 2 Samuel 24:24<\/p>\n<p>Most people enjoy getting something for free. \u00a0Recently my students asked me why everything can&#8217;t be for free. \u00a0I responded by saying everything costs somebody something. \u00a0Araunah the Jebusite attempted to give David a free offering so that David would have an offering to give to the Lord. \u00a0David responded by saying, &#8220;No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them.<\/p>\n<p>The Spirit Filled Life Bible points out &#8220;The threshing floor of Araunah was on Mount Moriah where Abraham offered Isaac (Gen. 22:2). \u00a0Abraham was told by God &#8220;Take your son , your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah&#8230; Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering.&#8221; \u00a0Abraham offered that which was precious to him, his son. \u00a0However, before Abraham brought down the knife upon his son, &#8220;the angel of the Lord called to him out of the heavens and said, &#8216;Abraham, Abraham&#8230;lay not a hand upon the lad&#8230;now I know that you fear God seeing you did not withhold your son, your only son from me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>How could David stand on the same plot of land that Abraham stood upon and not bring a costly offering. \u00a0Abraham was asked by God to offer his son as an act of obedience to God. \u00a0The Prophet Samuel said, Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? \u00a0To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams&#8221; (1 Sam 15:22). \u00a0When David brought the offering to the Lord there was a plague in<br \/>\nIsrael. \u00a02 Samuel 24:25 states, &#8220;David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the LORD answered prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped.&#8221; \u00a0David&#8217;s focus was upon the healing of others.<\/p>\n<p>Had you ever had a Garden of Gethsemane experience? \u00a0It was in a garden where Adam first said, &#8220;Not your will but mine be done,&#8221; and it was in a garden where Jesus fell to His knees and prayed, &#8220;Not my will but Yours be done.&#8221; \u00a0At the time, His disciples were asleep; so when it comes to being obedient to God, and sharing the gospel of truth with the unsaved, don&#8217;t be discouraged. \u00a0Simply get on your knees and pray Father, I desire to be obedient to you, and the thought of sharing my faith with others makes me sweat great drops of blood in fear. \u00a0Yet not my will, but Yours be done (Ray Comfort).&#8221; \u00a0God is still looking for those that would give an offering worth offering, an obedient life to Him. \u00a0Obedience is challenging, but if you&#8217;re like me, at the times that I don&#8217;t obey the Lord, it only makes things worse off. \u00a0There are so many people that are dying without Christ, because so many Christians are not being obedient to share their faith. \u00a0The late Bill Bright in his book, The Coming Revival, wrote that only 2 percent of Christians regularly share their faith with others.<\/p>\n<p>Are you being obedient to the voice of the Lord in your life? \u00a0Are you sharing your faith with others?<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"margin:0;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,&#8220;But the king (David) replied to Araunah, &#8220;No, I insist on paying you for it.

But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor.&#8221; (Genesis 4:3 &#8211; 5)<\/p>\n<p>In part one, we saw that an offering worth offering to God is one that is accurate (hits his heart) and one that is authentic (given out of our love of putting Him first).<\/p>\n<p>God respects when we bring the best of what we have to offer. Cain was a farmer that &#8220;brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord.&#8221; He brought an offering to God was it was not the best; it was second hand, leftovers. God supplied the seed, the hydration, and the sunlight to grow the fruit. God supplied the best environment that was needed to grow the fruit. Abel brought the best to the Lord. Abel was an animal keeper, most likely a shepherd that &#8220;brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock.&#8221; God supplied the initial animals, because unknown to Evolutionists, &#8220;the chicken did come before the egg.&#8221; God also supplied the food, water, etc&#8230; that the animals needed to grow and be healthy. I picture Abel looking at his sheep and thinking which one would God be pleased with to receive as an offering. Abel chose the top of the flock, and offered them to the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>God respects when we bring our offering by faith. Heb 11:4 gives further insight about these two brothers as it read, &#8220;By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.&#8221; If Abel gave God his best, then how would Abel breed more healthy sheep? Abel seemed to apply wisdom in not letting his left hand know what his right hand was doing. When Abel gave his best sheep, he saw his best leaving and not being replaced immediately. Abel gave by faith, not by sight. God supplies all our needs, and I believe that as God respected Abel&#8217;s offering, God supplied a healthy vibrant flock for him. Jesus said, &#8220;For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it.&#8221; In the same regards in God&#8217;s economy when we lose it (give it unto the Lord) we gain. When we try to keep it (holding back from the Lord) we lose. This was not so with Cain, who seemed to keep the best and give God the second best.<\/p>\n<p>God accepts offerings from those that belong to Him. Jesus spoke about false coverts (people that think that they are saved when they are not). Jesus told many parables about this including the parable of the sower, the foolish virgins (false) and the wise virgins (genuine), the good fish (genuine) and bad fish (false), the wheat (genuine) and tares (false), the sheep (genuine) and the goats (false). It seems that Cain foreshadowed the false while Abel foreshadowed the genuine. God accepted Abel&#8217;s offering, but rejected Cain&#8217;s. A father probably wouldn&#8217;t hang another child&#8217;s drawing on his refrigerator? However, he would proudly display his own child&#8217;s drawing on it? Cain&#8217;s heart did not submit to God&#8217;s heart, even though he approached God and gave God an offering. God accepted the offering from Abel as Abel&#8217;s heart did submit to God&#8217;s heart. A son wants to please his father, and does whatever is necessary to &#8220;win&#8221; his dads approval. Perhaps we can liken Cain and Abel to Judas (false) and Peter (genuine). Both were called to lay down their lives for Jesus, but only one did. Are you bringing God your best as an offering by faith because you genuinely belong to Him? Are you bringing an offering worth offering?

But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor.\u201d (Genesis 4:3 \u2013 5)<\/p>\n<p>Back when I was in Bible College God taught me a very humbling lesson. I was serving on the homeless outreach team that brought food, blankets, and clothing to the homeless on the streets of Philadelphia. It was winter time and there was a thin layer of snow on the ground. This night I was speaking to a man that asked if I had a pair of gloves for him. I looked proudly at my brand new warm leather gloves that I was wearing and thought there is no way that I am giving my gloves to this man. I looked down and saw a glove frozen into the snow. I picked it up, dusted it off and offered it to the man. With disappointment he turned and walked away from me.<\/p>\n<p>Later that evening while in my dorm room God severely convicted me of my pride and greed. God reminded me that I wore the gloves that He provided for me. The glove I offered to the cold man, God did not respect. I blew it bad because of my pride. I believe that something of this sort happened to Cain when he offered his offering to God in Genesis four.<\/p>\n<p>Cain and Abel both approached God, both brought an offering to God, both offerings were examined by God, but only one was respected by God. What made Abel\u2019s offering please the Lord? The writer of Hebrews gives us further insight. Heb 11:4 reads, \u201cBy faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.<\/p>\n<p>God respects an accurate offering \u201cThe LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering\u201d One must hit the bulls-eye when it comes to pleasing God. One can\u2019t just throw anything God\u2019s way an expect Him to honor it. In this case the bulls-eye is the heart of God. Abel hit God in the heart with his offering. Abel seemed to know what God would desire to receive from that which he blessed Abel with. Cain was angry with God, but did not offer an accurate offering. He wanted God to accept whatever he threw toward God. What has God blessed you with? Many unfortunately chock on their blessings, rather then bless the Lord with that which He has given. God\u2019s heart is about his glory and blessing others. How accurate of offering are you bringing to God? Is it connecting to His heart?<\/p>\n<p>God respects an authentic offering \u201cThe LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering.\u201d God looked with favor upon Abel. Abel desired to give God his very best. I believe Abel loved God with all his heart, mind, soul and strength. Abel was genuine toward God, he put God first. Abel placed God\u2019s glory before his own, because Abel was authentic. Cain\u2019s offering was not out of his love for God, he did not put God first. God didn\u2019t look with favor on Cain nor his offering. I believe Cain\u2019s offering was not genuine in the sense that it was given as though it were Cain\u2019s best, but God knew otherwise. Perhaps this is one of the reasons after Cain killed his brother that God said to Cain, \u201cIf you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it.\u201d One can\u2019t bring an offering with an unrighteous heart before God.

Different people have different view and conviction over reasoning with God. It&#8217;s like whatever the Lord says is final. I have always refused to pray, &#8220;Lord, whatever you choose to do, do it&#8221; and my simple reasons are, God has given me a chance to call on Him and ask Him. He says you don&#8217;t get because you don&#8217;t ask. Ask and it shall be given unto you, seek and you shall find, knock and the door shall be opened unto you. It may sound like being arrogant but this is His word, in His book and all I am doing is exercising it. MY ASKING, SEEKING AND KNOCKING IS LOOKING TO HIM TO ACT ON IT ACCORDING TO HIS WILL. My prayer is that, &#8220;Thy will be done on the matter I have presented to you&#8221; and His will could be yes, no, wait.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to reasoning with God, it&#8217;s kind of tough to deal with it. Could it be a sign of disobedience or a sign that we don&#8217;t recognize who He is and His position? He has said, &#8220;come now and let us reason together&#8221;, can you see that this His idea and not ours?. When I am coming to reason, I am aware of who He is and His position and all I am doing is humbling myself under His mighty hand. Just to bring something in mind real quick, have you ever questioned God or asked God a question? The two may look and sound the same but they are very different. Questioning would mean interrogating God with a lot of why and what questions. Asking God question I could say trying to find out what to learn from what you are experiencing. I wish I had some deeper meaning of the difference but this is how I look at it. There is something that is interesting about God that I don&#8217;t know how to explain it, when the bible says, &#8220;And the Lord remembered so and so&#8221;. Does it mean God had forgotten him or her? How about making something that will remind God of the covenant He made? Does this mean that there are times God forgets? You know what, He is God, He can choose to remember or forget and as for our sins, when we confess, He chooses to forget every bit of it.<\/p>\n<p>Moses reasoned with God when God was on the verge of wiping out the children of Israel in the desert. He says, (paraphrase), &#8220;What would the Egyptians think? They will say that you brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt to kill them in the desert&#8221; and also &#8220;That You were not God enough to bring them to their destiny&#8221;. Hezekiah also received a message from prophet Isaiah (I believe) that it was time for him to get his house in order for he was going to die. What did he do, he did not just say, &#8220;well that is what the Lord has chosen for me and I choose to go by it&#8221;, no, he did not even send Isaiah back to God, He went to God himself to reason with Him. All he could talk to God about was the word, &#8220;remember&#8221;. God had brought him from far, many things he suffered, he was just beginning to enjoy the blessings of the Lord, he did not feel ready to die yet. Abraham reasoned with God when God was out to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham approached God to reason with him and this is what he said (paraphrased), &#8220;Will you wipe the righteous people living in the Sodom?&#8221;, Suppose there are 50 righteous people, will you destroy Sodom? and the Lord said, &#8220;If there are 50 righteous people, I will spare the city&#8221;. This happened until the number dropped to about five if I remember well. Gideon reasoned with God and so was Elijah and many more.<\/p>\n<p>All these people had one thing ion common, their reasoning was inform of intercession which means standing in the gap and pleading with God. Reasoning with God over your loved ones, yourself, your situation, your ministry, His calling in your life. This is not trying to twist the arm of God to do whatever you want, this is allowing God to see the situation in the way that you see it and He in turn acting on it according to His will. Abraham reasoned with God but there were no enough people to spare Sodom so He took Lot out of Sodom and destroyed the city. Suppose Abraham had not reasoned with God, maybe Lot and his family would have perished. If Moses did not reason with God, maybe God would have destroyed the Israelites. &#8220;Come now let us reason together says the Lord&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Isaiah 1:18, &#8220;&#8230; &#8220;Though your sins are like scarlet, They shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, They shall be as wool&#8221;. One of the verses I believe in Psalms David reasons with God by saying, &#8220;If you hold on to my transgressions, who will stand?&#8221;. As we come to reason, regardless of how our sins may look or sound, He will wash us as snow and though they may be red, soiled and stained, they shall be as wool that as we reason, we reason with pure hearts. I love to plead and reason with God for it has many times done me well. We were once alienated and now adopted to call God Abba Father.

You have the words of eternal life&#8221; It was tough for the disciples to grasp everything Jesus said for Jesus spoke in the spirit while the people tried to analyze it in the natural. With this, the disciples complained. The more you have your foot in the worldly things and the more the flesh is in control, the Spirit will point out things in your life that need to be changed. You may not understand why and may even be offended. God knows how to bring us to a Spiritual level where we appreciate everything He is doing in our lives and through our lives. Though some of them may be tough, but we know that He has a good reason for shaping us that way. Someone asked an individual who makes sculptures how he would make an elephant sculpture off tree trunk. His response was, &#8220;Chop what does not look like an elephant off the tree trunk and what you will be left with will be an elephant sculpture&#8221;,<\/p>\n<p>We have God chopping off what does not look like Him in our lives that He may be left with a people with His own image. The chopping part is difficult and painful but it is good for us. The disciples had the option to give up on Him but looking at where they had come from, the things they abandoned, the friends they kissed goodbye and how they had managed to make it this far by God&#8217;s grace, they could not just see where else to go. I look at my life and I ask myself the same question, where can I go?, I have given up so much to live for Him, the road at times get rough and bumpy and His words are very convicting and I need to change even more to be like Him. There also times I walk in the flesh and what He is saying is not clicking but where can I go?. Peter says, &#8220;You have the words of eternal life&#8221;. As many as kissed Jesus goodbye, the disciples also had the same chance but they could not.<\/p>\n<p>Lord I refuse to go back even if others are going back. I don&#8217;t know what I would do without You in my life, so keep giving me the bread of the life for I need it now more than ever. See it&#8217;s not the Lord who wanted to give up on people, it&#8217;s the people who wanted to give up on the Lord. He knew their hearts from the beginning and yet He did not leave them, Romans 8:38&amp;39, &#8220;For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor the things to come. Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Friends, I am fully persuaded that Christ will not give up on us come rain or sunshine and our prayer and desire is that nothing, I mean nothing will separate us from our love for Him. I am determined to keep on walking with Him as tough as it may be, after all I have no where to go, He is my everything. I will look around and I will see many go back but I refuse to go back. With all said and done, &#8220;Lord, NO ONE ELSE BUT YOU!!!&#8221;.

(1 Corinthians 1:30 \u2013 31)<\/p>\n<p>Many hold that the foolishness of God is an oxymoron. Two words that seemingly contradict each other, i.e. jumbo shrimp, honest politician, good devotional \ud83d\ude09 etc. When I read this oxymoron, &#8220;foolishness of God,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;now that is the ultimate oxymoron!&#8221; God being foolish &#8212; that is impossible! But as you look deeper into this and think through the Bible about all the seemingly foolish ways of God, the term takes on new meaning. Remember in Genesis 6-8 when Noah, built a barge and barge parked in his \u201cdriveway\u201d for 120 years, to save 8 people. In Judges 15:16 we read about how Samson kills thousands of Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. In 1 Samuel 17 we read of the lowly shepherd boy, David, killing the giant Goliath. On and on throughout the Bible, God uses things that are foolish to the world, to shame the wise.<\/p>\n<p>1. We are in Christ \u201cBut of him are you in Christ Jesus.\u201d If I put a sponge in a bucket of water, is the water in the sponge or is the sponge in the water? In this scenario both are true. We are in Christ Jesus, because we have confessed and repented of our sins and put our faith in Jesus Christ. If one were about to jump out of a plane, it is not enough to believe in a parachute, one must put it on. We have put on the Lord Jesus Christ and our trust is in Him alone for our salvation.<\/p>\n<p>2. We have wisdom in our lives. \u201cGod is made unto us wisdom\u201d, The Scriptures say, \u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\u2026\u201d To fear our Lord is the starting place of wisdom. How can we really claim to have anything useful as far as knowledge, if we don\u2019t acknowledge the One in whom is life, and truth, the Creator God Himself?<\/p>\n<p>3. We have [His] righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption Ro 3:22 \u201cThis righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. 1Th 5:23 \u201cMay God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through\u2026\u201d Ps 111:9 He provided redemption for his people; he ordained his covenant forever\u2014holy and awesome is his name.<\/p>\n<p>?4. We Glorify the Lord \u201c\u2026He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.\u201d? When one realizes that they are in Christ, when one fears God, and has God righteousness, sanctification, and redemption imputed upon him or her, one must acknowledge that all of these things come not from flesh and blood but from God. \u201cThis is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying Not by might?b?, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The foolishness of God impacts people by impacting people inside with His spirit, so that they will give Him the glory for what He has done, in them, with them, and through them. The clay pot is only worth something because the Potter has formed the lump of clay into something fit for the Potters use. Isaiah said, in 64:8 \u201cYet, O LORD, you are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.\u201d The Potter gets the glory not the clay. In the foolishness of God, He works through us to receive glory from us. In the foolishness of God when He works in your life, who do you give the glory to? How will you give Him glory today?

As long as we are in the natural, in the carnal stuff, we will behave, argue, think, do things in the flesh but the flesh will not survive for long and I believe that is the reason why Jesus wanted them to have the bread of life that they would operate in the Spirit and not in the flesh. Flesh can and will always deceive, flesh wants it&#8217;s own ways but the moment Christ comes in, the flesh has to be crucified. Are you getting upset because you have been convicted about getting out of the flesh and having the bread of life? Christ took care of your needs when you first came to Him but now He is letting you know that there is more to Him than just the natural.<\/p>\n<p>John 6:63, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life, the flesh profits nothing.

It&#8217;s not God&#8217;s only intentions to give us things pertaining to this life, His greatest gift to us is eternal life, eternal things that do not perish. He gives us what will not just keep us in this life but the things that will keep us in eternity. The Sprit of God through Jesus Christ gives us life. We are just in this world for a very short time and as we look around and hear things, we are reminded that the time is very short and Christ could be coming back any minute, are you ready for His coming?<\/p>\n<p>John 6&#8243;66, &#8220;From that time many of His disciples went back and walked with Him no more&#8221;, because the menu changed, many could not stand walking with Him and desiring to be changed completely to follow the Lord. In today&#8217;s life, as long as our physically needs are met, many do want to sow even higher with the Lord for they are comfortable where they are. Thank God for the bread of life to keep us moving. We are not dismissing the fact that we need the necessities for our survival but we are not putting emphasis on it as our way of coming to the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Lord give me this bread to feed my Sprit everyday, the flesh many times want to take over but help me allow Your spirit to arise that the flesh may be removed. Help me crucify the flesh in order for it to have no say in my destiny &#8220;. Don&#8217;t leave God because the supply has been cut off, He is giving you the bread of life to teach you many more things that pertains to the kingdom therefore stick in there until the class is over (eternity).

You have the words of eternal life&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The reason why serve Christ was covered yesterday and I remember mentioning that it&#8217;s good to have the Lord bless us but we should bless the Lord first. To continue from where we left.<\/p>\n<p>John 6:27, &#8220;Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him&#8221;. From the beginning we see people who come to Jesus following Him because of His teachings but after sometime when they had been fed, they began to look for Jesus not for the Spiritual stuff but for food. He set them straight by letting them know of their agenda. First thing after revealing to them their motive, He tells them not to labor for food (natural) which perishes. During the time of the Children of Israel in the wilderness, the manner was provided for them everyday and it was suppose to be enough just for one day, any food saved went bad. The instruction was to eat enough and wait for a new one the next day but some people decided to save some. What you might really be trying to hold onto on the natural could spoil tomorrow for the natural does not last. Everything that we do and encounter with will come and go but the word of the Lord which is the bread of life will stand forever. Isaiah 40:8, says &#8220;The grass withers, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand forever&#8221;. Money will go so are friends, beauty and fame will diminish all that will be left is the Christ, the bread of life. Laboring just for food which is other words just material things will only try and satisfy the physical part but the spiritual part and emotional part are left out but when you have the bread of life, not only will it feed you spiritually, it will cover but both the physical and the emotional. It&#8217;s the bread that sustains one through it all, Mathew 4:4, &#8220;&#8230;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God&#8221;. The word will teach you what faith is all about, being victorious, standing strong, healing, how to live right and it&#8217;s through the word that things will in order. Jesus wanted them to move from the little provision they knew about to a greater provision which will help them even in His absence. He wanted them to get the word as that was a sign of wanting to know the Lord. I am not coming because of what I can gain from You Lord, I am coming that I may know You. Listen to Paul&#8217;s desire, Philippians 3:10, &#8220;That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering, being made conformable unto His death&#8221;. Paul longed for more of the eternal bread. Let the Spirit arise and the flesh be removed!!!!<\/p>\n<p>John 6:34&amp;35, &#8220;Then they said to Him, &#8220;Lord, give us this bread always&#8221;, vs. 35, &#8220;And Jesus said to them, &#8220;I am the bread of life. He who comes to me shall never hunger, and He who believes in me shall never thirst&#8221;. Menu change from the natural bread to the eternal (flesh and blood). &#8220;You for the natural, I&#8217;m giving you the supernatural. Mathew 5:6, &#8220;Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness: for they shall be filled&#8221;. Anyone who begins to hunger for the Bread of life is already blessed for the promise of fulfillment is already given. The Samaritan woman kept on coming to the well to get the natural water but when Jesus showed up, He gave her something much more fulfilling than the natural water. Let me clarify, being born again is not having the void in our lives filled, it&#8217;s about fleeing the wrath of God having violated His laws through repentance and putting our trust in Christ alone for our eternal salvation, the filling takes place because you belong. John 6:51, &#8220;I am the living bread which came down from heaven&#8230;; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, John 6:1-68, &#8220;But Simon Peter answered Him, &#8220;Lord, to whom shall we go?

You have the words of eternal life&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I ask myself the reason why I serve Christ. I am aware of the reason for my existence and that is to worship, walk and work with the Lord and the rest of the things become benefits. Did I come to Christ so as just to escape hell and the wrath to come? or did I come to Christ because of what I could gain from Him? or did I come to Christ because of who He is? I believe that the order of the affection does affect tremendously how we live for Christ. My priority is to lift Him up, John 12:32, &#8220;And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto Me&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The book of John starts by telling us about Jesus feeding five thousand. These people had been following Jesus around the Sea of Galilee teaching them, healing those who needed healing and the ones who did not need healing were there to see the signs and wonders being performed. As time went by, it fell on Passover feast of the Jews and Jesus looking up and seeing the people that followed Him, He knew they were hungry for they had walked with Him for a long time without stopping to eat. The multitude was great and there was no food around to feed these people. He speaks with Phillip about getting food for the people but first testing him to see if he would trust in Christ to perform a miracle or look at the circumstance and try and see what could be done in the natural to feed these people. We know that later Jesus used a small boy&#8217;s lunch 2 fishes and 5 loaves of bread to feed the five thousand men. The bible does not mention the women and the children which makes me believe there were more than 5 thousand. John 6:11, &#8220;And Jesus took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed them to the disciples&#8230;&#8221;, Instead of Jesus praying for increase and multiplication, He gives thanks and gives out the little in His hands. We are brooding a generation of complainers and murmurers, people who feel they do not have enough and that could be true but even Jesus who did not have enough gave thanks even with the little. 1Thessalonians 5:17, &#8220;pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ concerning you&#8221;. It&#8217;s not only giving thanks FOR it only but giving thanks IN it for it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will that we give Him thanks in everything.<\/p>\n<p>These people loved the free food for the next day they looked for Jesus again. In the beginning they were interested in knowing what Jesus had to say and after He fed them, they loved the idea of being fed more than what they could hear. We can say that these people had a bad habit but wait a second, hold on tight, we do the same many times, I have come across people who walked with Christ on basis of what He did. It was about what He could do for them and when things went bad, they abandoned their faith. They came on the basis of the promised peace, joy, happiness and provisions. Job went through something like that when the devil told God that the reason Job was serving Him was because of what God had bestowed upon Job. We know of how God allowed the devil to take away everything that Job had to see if Job would give up on God and this is what he said, Job 13:15, &#8220;Though He slay me, yet I will trust Him, but I will maintain mine own ways before Him&#8221;. Regardless of the situation, he could not give up on God as this was a reminder for Job that he wasn&#8217;t following God because of what He could gain from Him but because of who He is. So listen to Jesus response to the people, John 6:26, &#8220;&#8230;most assuredly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled&#8221;. Their motives are revealed and now it&#8217;s time to divide the wheat and the chaff. Their reaction to Jesus&#8217; word will reveal completely why they came to Christ. Why do you follow Christ? and if you are not, why are you not following Christ? Do you wait until you run into a jam to look to Him cause you know that He is the only one that can help you out?<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s is good to know that Christ always comes to our rescue according to Psalms 46:1, &#8220;God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble&#8221; but is that the main reason why we serve Christ? We love to use this word, Lord bless us, how about We Bless the Lord?. Psalm 103:1, &#8220;Bless the Lord Oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name&#8221;, Psalm 34, &#8220;I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually be in my mouth&#8221;. Lord I thank you for the blessings that you have bestowed upon me but I pray that it will not be the reason why I serve You. May I serve because of who You are period and let me not confuse the benefits with the Benefactor.

As I&#8217;m put this message together, someone has been disappointed in the last few days. If you&#8217;ve never been disappointed, I guess you haven&#8217;t hit puberty yet. Disappointed in your job, relationship, boss, children, church, friends. Either you will disappoint someone or they will be disappointed by you, that is a fact of life. Disappointment simply means a feeling of dissatisfaction that results when your expectations are not realized.<\/p>\n<p>Disappointments go hand in hand with shock because it just darned to you that what you had hopes for, worked for, groomed, expected has turned out to be something else. Shock leads to lock in, being extra careful, cautious and not ready to go through the same path again because of what you experienced last time. Often times disappointments leave people disoriented, confused leading them to want to do something they will regret later. It could lead to trying to frustrate the person who has disappointed you so as to get even with them or lead you to stay away. How can one deal with disappointments? I really don&#8217;t have a concrete answer but let me share with you how God has taught me to deal with them.<\/p>\n<p>First lets look at three men Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego. These men were brought from Israel to serve in the land of Babylon but not as slaves. Men required for the job had to be, Daniel 1:4, &#8220;young men in whom there was no blemish, but good-looking, gifted in all wisdom, possessing knowledge and quick to understand, who had ability to serve in the king&#8217;s palace, and whom they might teach the language and literature of the Chaldeans&#8221;. By looking at what was needed, these men had all the qualities. They saw themselves living in the king&#8217;s palace, serving in the high ranks and they did until one day a decree was passed that everyone was expected to bow to an idol. I can imagine them being disappointed because what they hoped for has been changed. They came to serve the king but not his gods, they had a God whom they were serving and living for. They had been faithful to the Almighty God, why would they be in a place of disappointment at this time? After a while, it&#8217;s explained to them about the furnace heated seven times just for them if they did not bow but this was their response, Daniel 3:16-18, &#8220;&#8230;, &#8220;O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. 17, If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18, But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.&#8221; Why would they speak this way in this situation?, They had shock absorbers. Unless you have shock absorbers, disappointments will ruin your life. What are shock absorbers? Shock is a violent collision or impact, simply a heavy blow what disappointments are. Absorbers means enduring or accommodating. Cars have absorbers to help steady the impact on the bumps and pot holes it might or will hit. Shock absorbers help level what is already there and that is what the three young men did. I believe they looked at what the Lord had done in their lives. The qualities and the abilities they had that some other young men did not have and that became their shock absorbers. Though disappointed in one area, what had been done could not be compared to what lied a head of them. Because of that, they were able bounce back with a new message, &#8220;Our God whom we serve is able&#8230;&#8221;, their shock absorber was on what God had done and what God could do, &#8220;&#8230;But if not&#8230;&#8221;, you can not make a statement like this without having your shock absorbers. These men&#8217;s minds were made up, their disappointments could not keep them down. Would you allow your disappointments to keep you down when you have your shock absorbers?<\/p>\n<p>Bounce back, shake it off, get right back on the track, move on, put everything that has happened in the past only carry what can boost you a head. Let it go, let it fade in the dark. If you got to cry, swim through your tears, dry it out and kiss it goodbye because God has given you shock absorbers. Don&#8217;t allow your disappointments to dictate what you can be, you can use them to create new appointments. For the three men, their disappointments allowed them to see God in a new dimension cause they created appointments out of them. If you&#8217;ve been disappointed, find your shock absorbers and bounce back on the track.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Daniel 3:17&amp;18, &#8220;&#8230;our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. 18, But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-540","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-8I","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/540","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=540"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/540\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=540"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=540"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=540"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":539,"date":"2006-09-27T11:50:08","date_gmt":"2006-09-27T11:50:08","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/09\/27\/undo-whats-been-done-part-2\/"},"modified":"2006-09-28T11:53:25","modified_gmt":"2006-09-28T11:53:25","slug":"undo-whats-been-done-part-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/09\/27\/undo-whats-been-done-part-2\/","title":{"rendered":"Undo What&#8217;s Been Done, Part&nbsp;2"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 26:15-34, &#8220;And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>We began to look at undoing what the enemy has done and that is going back to dig the wells covered. People pray for revival and I believe in revival but the definition people have given revival is not actually what it is. Revival is coming again into activity and prominence. This what Isaac needed to do, revive the wells to be effective, productive, living, flourishing. Are you reviving your wells? God could have told him to dig new ones but the word of God says He is a God of restoration (reviving), bringing back to life that which is dead, Joel 2:25, &#8220;So I will restore (revive) to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, The crawling locust, The consuming locust, And the chewing locust, My great army which I sent among you&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 26:25, &#8220;So he built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD, and he pitched his tent there; and there Isaac&#8217;s servants dug a well&#8221;. God will not say something He has no answer for. To us it may sound foolish but to Him He knows what He is doing. If you are living by facts, you will not make it with God for long cause many things that God does and asks us to do don&#8217;t make sense but they sure work. You go and revive your wells Isaac and I will cause water to flow says the Lord. Revive your altars before Him, revive your prayer life and let Him cause His Living Water to flow. His Water will quench the thirst you always have when nothing else satisfies. Thank God for His promises that never fails. Men may fail but God will never, the bible says that He is not a man that he should lie neither is He the son of man that He should repent, if He said it, surely it will come to pass. Surely means without fail, we may not know the timing but surely we know He will. If He created out of nothing, He will make His water run from the unexpected.<\/p>\n<p>Because Isaac went back and dug the wells, God caused the water to flow and the Philistines saw clearly in vs. 28 that the Lord was with Isaac. They had been hostile to him but after seeing the Lord&#8217;s doing, Isaac found favor with them and he also showed them kindness. We still have much to do in our surrounding. To be effective, we have to have our wells with water. Why are you not affecting your department, is it because you have allowed an enemy to fill your wells of joy, peace, favor, confidence, hope with guilt, shame, pride, fear and habits? You have a reason now to undo what&#8217;s been done cause you need your well of salvation running. You have a job to do, undo what&#8217;s been done.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 26:15-34, &#8220;And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father&#8221; We began to look at undoing what the enemy has done and that is going back to dig the wells covered.

Human survival depends on water. God has referred Himself as the Living Water that quenches the thirst of men. The Samaritan woman in the John 4 came to the well to draw water and right at the well, she meets Jesus who asks for water then later claims that He has water that can make her thirst no more. She desired this water, do we?<\/p>\n<p>That sounds so good but here is the problem. Abraham had dug wells, at a later time, the philistines (enemies) came and filled them with earth (soil). They covered them up and water would not flow anymore. Genesis 26:15 &#8220;Now the Philistines had stopped up all the wells which his father&#8217;s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, and they had filled them with earth&#8221;. Do you realize that you have an enemy constantly trying to fill your wells with dirt? You lost your effectiveness because water is not flowing in your well, the enemy covered it up. You have become rigid, dry and gasping for breath. The desert scotching sun has left you weary to a point of giving up. You wonder what happened to the healing, restoration and deliverance promised by God to His children. And the most important thing, you have lost connection with God. The explanation is simple, &#8220;you well is covered up&#8221;. Don&#8217;t expect new wells to be dug, you got to go back the old wells and dig them up. Running from place to place is not the answer, self-pity will not work, you have a job to do, rise up and go to work.<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 26:18, &#8220;And Isaac dug again the wells of water which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father&#8221;. Your survival depends on whether you have water running. Dig your wells again, you need that first love, that fire to serve Christ, the passion to witness, desire for greater things in line with His will cause they are in that well covered up. You encounter with the living water, you will not thirst again. No one will do it for you, you have to take a stand and say, &#8220;I will dig my wells again&#8221;. &#8220;I can&#8217;t go on living a defeated life because I allowed the enemy to fill my wells&#8221;. The enemy knows that is where my life is and that is why he filled them up. Isaiah 12:3, &#8220;Therefore with joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation&#8221;. Don&#8217;t you know that right where you are you have a well of salvation that has more to offer than just salvation? Psalm 103:2, &#8220;Bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not HIS BENEFITS&#8221;. Wells of salvation has benefits, dig them again, undo what&#8217;s been done. will finish.

If we based our salvation on feeling then we are in trouble. If we are to feel God to know He is present then we still lack understanding that God is ever present. The one thing I hear many say when they are in trying times is &#8220;how come I don&#8217;t feel God in my situation&#8221;. This is the whole reason why we can live a defeated life if our whole experience is based on whether I feel God present or not and if He is, why is He silent in my situation.<\/p>\n<p>In Mark 39:35 onwards, One evening Jesus tells the disciples to cross with him to the other side. He had been teaching the multitudes. I believe in the teaching, there were a lot of things to learn and &#8220;faith&#8221; could have been one of them. The bible says, &#8220;Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God&#8221;, faith learnt in class room yet to be mastered in the sea of life. Some of the teachings were not new to them for they listened to the Master teach many times. To cross to the other side required a means of boat to make it. And the bible says, in verse 37 that a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. 38 But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. In their sailing, they faced a situation that challenged their faith. Everything was okay when they left, Jesus was present with them but when the situation a rose, Jesus was no where to be found because he was at the bottom of the boat peacefully sleeping. Imagine the boat beginning to fill with water as the bible mentions it, who would have been affected by the water first? Jesus. While in this tough situation, the tried to steady the boat on their own, they were getting hysterical. One thing they were lacking was PEACE and because they lacked PEACE, they could not have JOY.<\/p>\n<p>Here is my point to all these, Romans 15:13, &#8220;&#8230; may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in BELIEVING. Mark that it&#8217;s not saying to be filled with joy and peace in FEELING. There are times feelings will fail you. Through His teachings, Jesus was filling them with hope that it might produce peace and joy in every tough time they would face in life and this might have been a little test to see if they could put into practice what they learnt. The disciples should have been filled with peace and joy in believing that the presence of Jesus on the boat was enough to make them sail through the windstorm. Just knowing that even if He was a sleep, even if they could not feel his presence in the middle of the windstorm, knowing that He was somewhere within the boat was enough to produce peace and joy.<\/p>\n<p>You might say, &#8220;how would that happen?&#8221;, well if Jesus was in this boat that was being rocked by the wind, water coming inside and He was peaceful, don&#8217;t you think that should have filled them with peace and joy? And if that was not enough to give them peace and joy, think about it, do you think that Jesus who is 100% God could have drowned??. What about you in your boat sailing in this sea of life, facing windstorm, you are loosing your peace and joy because you might have based everything on feelings which go with happiness. Don&#8217;t you believe that God of hope can fill you with His peace and joy in believing that He is ever present in your boat? That as long as He lives inside of you you cannot drown because He can&#8217;t drown? 1 John 4:4, says, &#8221; You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. This verse alone gives me peace and joy knowing that He is greater in me than the challenge before me. I can ride through the storm believing that He is present. If I don&#8217;t feel Him, that is still ok for I know He did not leave me. I can smile in the midst of the storm because His peace surpasses all understanding and his joy is unspeakable in me. I can make it not because everything is in place but because 2 Timothy 1:12 &#8230;I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day&#8221;.

In the wisdom of God they NEVER found God. The late Dr. Walter Martin said, &#8220;The golden ages of Greece lead the Greeks to Plato&#8217;s philosophy, utter disaster, moral chaos, and multiple-polytheistic worship. They came up with a god for everything under the sun and one for the sun itself. Zeus, Athena, Aphrodite, were the gods they conceived yet they each had human characteristics, including sin, and could overcome and be overcome by humanity.&#8221; The totality of mans wise efforts to find God, ended up in divine bankruptcy. And to rephrase Paul&#8217;s sarcastic words towards the ungodly, &#8220;In the wisdom of God the world by wisdom couldn&#8217;t get itself arrested.&#8221; It couldn&#8217;t find out anything about God.<\/p>\n<p>I love the dialog in Matthew 16, where Jesus asks His twelve, &#8220;But who do you say that I am? 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, &#8216;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&#8217;. 17 And Jesus answered and said to him, &#8216;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven'&#8221;. Although it is logical and completely reasonable to believe in God, the revelation of God does not come through flesh and blood, not through the wisdom of this world. What is the difference between the wisdom of this world and the wisdom of God? Perhaps the following illustration will shed light on this subject.<\/p>\n<p>The Sinking Ship (Taken from the Evidence Bible) Imagine for a moment that you are standing on the seashore gazing at a large ocean liner. The sun is shining. There is no wind and the sea is calm. To your amazement, about thirty people suddenly dive off the end of the ship and cling to a lifeboat. You shake your head in disbelief at their foolishness. Then without warning, the great ocean liner strikes an iceberg and suddenly sinks, taking all on board with it. Those who looked like fools in abandoning the ship were actually wise, and those who seemed wise by staying on board were, in truth, fools. The world scoffs at those who abandon the ship of this world and cling to the lifeboat of the Savior. But Christians know that this great pleasure-cruiser will eventually come into contact with the immovable iceberg of the Law of God, sink into hell . . . and take all those on board with it.<\/p>\n<p>1. God makes foolish the wisdom of this world. 2. The world&#8217;s wisdom does not lead to God. 3. God is pleased when His &#8220;foolish&#8221; Gospel is preached toward those that believe. 4. Some seek a sign but yet cannot see the &#8220;sign&#8221; of the Cross. 5. Some seek worldly wisdom to try to know God, but it doe not lead to Him. 6. Knowing God comes through a Divine revelation.<\/p>\n<p>God has given His wisdom to His children. He desires His children to appropriate that wisdom to serve Him with one&#8217;s whole heart, mind, soul, and strength. God&#8217;s wisdom is acquired through conforming to His will.

These messages are good and we should love them but the messages on holiness, righteousness, purity, sanctification, concentration, servant hood should have a greater impact in a life of a believer. The Benefactor is more to me than benefits!!!!<\/p>\n<p>If you apply for a job in a company, the main thing is not the benefits but the job itself.\u00a0 As you discuss the nature of the job, the requirements, the salary, the environment, the expectations somewhere in between you will discuss the benefits. I don&#8217;t think that anyone applies for a job primarily for benefits. With this in mind, the first question I ask myself, why I&#8217;m I serving Christ? Why did I come to Christ?. I believe that our understanding about why we serve Christ helps eliminates many things that we get frustrated about for we have a clear understanding of why we chose or Christ chose us in the first place. Did I come to serve because He promised me life enhancement, happiness, comfort? Why are you serving Christ?<\/p>\n<p>I came to Christ primarily because He offered me the gift of eternal life in order to escape the wrath to come. The bible says in Hebrews 9:27, &#8220;And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this is judgment&#8221; and His judgment will not be based on the life enhancement, it will be based on whether I repented, my sins forgiven and received eternal life. If coming to Christ is to receive the gift of eternal life, then serving Christ is to maintain the gift and letting more people know how they too can receive it. If someone shared with you and pointed you to Christ, you should be compelled to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>Serving Christ does have benefits too, Psalm 103:1-4, &#8220;&#8230;, Bless the Lord, O my soul and forget not His benefits, Who forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who redeem your life from destruction, who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies, who satisfies your mouth with goods things etc&#8221;. So should I give up on Christ because some of these benefits are not provided? no, because my coming to Him was to receive the gift of eternal life. We need to put the emphasis on the hope to come and not on the benefits.<\/p>\n<p>Serving Christ is not about happiness but righteousness. We who have received Christ have eternal life, a life beyond the grave. Romans 14:17, &#8220;For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost&#8221;. Meat and drink always goes with happiness but for us believers it&#8217;s more than that, it&#8217;s righteousness, holiness, purity, joy, unspeakable joy in the Holy Ghost. Happiness depends on the circumstance, joy depends on the promise that regardless of what happens, I have the joy of knowing that one day when this life is over I will be in heaven.<\/p>\n<p>1Peter 3:15, &#8220;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense (reason) to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear&#8221;. Sanctify is to set apart for sacred use, it&#8217;s also to make holy and purify. The definition I love, sanctify is to make productive of holiness. The Lord is holy and because He lives inside of us, we have to set ourselves apart in readiness for His use, we have to desire holiness and purity. Our uniqueness will raise questions and what a joy to stand and respond confidently the reason why we serve Christ. Christ in us the hope of glory, surely someone will ask you about Him, are you ready to give an answer? If asked, we will answer with meekness (submissive, patient, humbleness) and fear (extreme reverence). Don&#8217;t know about you, but I want to be different in the sight of men and when they ask me what makes me different, I will not be afraid and intimidated to speak about thehope that is in me. This will also remind me more about why I serve Christ.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Peter 3:15, &#8220;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense (reason) to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear&#8221; We appreciate messages on life enhancements, steps to happiness, how to live a successful life, how [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-534","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-8C","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/534","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=534"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/534\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=534"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=534"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=534"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":532,"date":"2006-09-18T10:42:02","date_gmt":"2006-09-18T10:42:02","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/09\/18\/fighting-scared\/"},"modified":"2006-09-19T10:44:39","modified_gmt":"2006-09-19T10:44:39","slug":"fighting-scared","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/09\/18\/fighting-scared\/","title":{"rendered":"Fighting Scared"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>2Timothy 1:7, &#8220;For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Fear is one of the greatest battles I face everyday and I constantly fight it for I know it&#8217;s not of God.

There is a fear of going to greater levels for there is a feeling of incompetence, fear to marry and who to marry and not feel like a mistake is made, fear of flying for what has happened in the past, fear of getting into ministry for you do not feel qualified. We have all kinds of fears circulating in our lives. Let&#8217;s look at one man who had so many fears to deal with.<\/p>\n<p>Judges 6:11, &#8220;&#8230;Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress, in order to hide from the midianites&#8221;. Gideon is hiding because he is afraid of the enemy, we have our own enemies who inflict fears in our lives but the bible says, Psalm 23:4, &#8220;Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You are with me&#8221;. The enemy is always out to kill, steal and destroy but we have a covering and assurance that no matter what we deal with, we will not fear evil for God is with us.<\/p>\n<p>Judges 6:23, &#8220;Then the Lord said to him, &#8220;peace be with you; do not fear, you shall not die&#8221;, Here we see how Gideon has encountered with the Lord and he is afraid for we saw this many times when people encountered with God in the old testament, there would be such a fear for it was not always something possible unless you were chosen by God to reach out to His people through what He had to say. Judges 6:27, &#8220;&#8230;But because he feared his father&#8217;s household and the men of the city too much to do it by day, he did it by night&#8221;. As the Lord was directing Gideon and Gideon was beginning to know the Lord he had never known, he offers a sacrifice to the Lord which was good and the Lord gave him another instruction to tear down the altar of Baal which was the idol Gideon&#8217;s people worshipped. Because of the fear in his life, he does it but he does it at night and by morning all the idols are destroyed.<\/p>\n<p>Judges 6:36, &#8220;So Gideon said to God, &#8220;If You will save Israel by my hands as You have said&#8221;, vs. 37, &#8220;look, I shall put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is a dew on the fleece only, and it&#8217;s dry on all the ground then I shall know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said&#8221;. Once again we see Gideon with another fear and that is the fear to trust. He has encountered with the Lord and so far everything looks good until the Lord tells him that he is chosen him to save Israel. For him to trust and believe, he asks the Lord to perform certain miracles and to my amazement, the Lord is patient with him and does as he has requested. I believe that as the Lord prepares us to be instruments, yes we might have fear but He will be patient enough with us to work with us and reveal to us what He can do that our total trust may strangle the fear inside of us.<\/p>\n<p>Judges 7:2, &#8220;And the Lord said to Gideon, &#8220;The people who are with you are too many&#8230;, vs. 3. &#8220;Now therefore proclaim in the hearing of the people saying, &#8220;whoever is fearful and afraid, let him turn and depart at once from a Mount Gilead&#8221;. And 22,000 of the people returned&#8221;. The Lord has a sense of humor for He is telling Gideon that the people he has are too many to fight the battle hence not taking glory from God and then He tells him to release all the people who are fearful and afraid. Remember that the leader is fearful and afraid and should be the first one to leave but he is not for the Lord is already dealing with his fear as time goes by. Through this, the Lord is building him up not to put his confidence and trust in man.<\/p>\n<p>Judges 7:9, &#8220;It happened on the same night that the Lord said to him, &#8220;Arise, go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into you hand, vs. 10, &#8220;But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp&#8230;&#8221; vs. 11, &#8220;And you will hear what they say; and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp&#8221;. I thought the Lord finished dealing with his fears. Gideon is still afraid but he is sticking with God, He is fighting scared and he keeps on moving, one last thing before his strike helps him see that what is fearful about is actually nothing for the Lord sends him to the camp and if you read the portion of the scripture you will find that in as much as Gideon was fearful of the enemy, the enemy was more fearful than him and his people. It is very possible that what we are really fearful about is actually afraid of us meaning that it can be conquered<\/p>\n<p>We have a chance to fight scared, someone said that, &#8220;Courage is not the absence of fear, it&#8217;s the force that concurs it&#8221;. I want to overcome fear for God has not given me a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sound mind that I may be aware of the enemy&#8217;s plans. I don&#8217;t want to leave and go back like the 22,000 who left but I want to move forward even if I am fighting scared so Lord help me!!<\/p>\n<p>Thanks,<br \/>\nEvans\u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 2Timothy 1:7, &#8220;For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind&#8221; Fear is one of the greatest battles I face everyday and I constantly fight it for I know it&#8217;s not of God.

What are the things you dream most of obtaining in this life? Are your dreams material things or immaterial things? Do they fulfill a need or greed in your life? Are they only about yourself, or are your desires centered on providing for or helping others? Is your dreams family oriented and godly centered? <\/p>\n<p>David tells us in Psalm 37:3 that one of the first steps to receiving your desires is to &#8220;Trust in the Lord and do good.&#8221; The Trust Factor is something everyone exhibits on a daily basis. There are surely those that are less trusting, but I don&#8217;t believe that there are any that are non &#8211; trusting. Are you sitting down as you read this devotion? If so then you are trusting in a chair to hold your weight up. Did you drink coffee, tea, orange juice or some other beverage this morning? If so then you trusted that those who made your beverage didn&#8217;t poison it. Thank God! To trust God is like sitting in a chair, believing that the chair manufacturer made the chair with a promise to hold you up as you sit it. The Promises of my Life&#8217;s Manufacturer, the Lord Himself, are 100% true. Now I have seen people sit on chairs and the chairs have broken in the process. However, I have never seen any one of my Heavenly Fathers Promises broken. Why, because He who promised is true. How is your trust level, do you trust God? <\/p>\n<p>Secondly, David tells us &#8220;do good.&#8221; Doing good are doing those things that please the God you trust in. We shouldn&#8217;t trust pray for a job, but need to also fill out applications. One shouldn&#8217;t only pray to know God&#8217;s will, but also read his Word where His Will is revealed. God doesn&#8217;t throw worms in the mouths (beaks) of birds, but as they are searching He makes sure they find them. Not everything you deem as good will God merit as good and His perspective is always true. What good are you doing at this time in your life? <\/p>\n<p>Thirdly, &#8220;Be fed.&#8221; As you trust in the Lord and do good, God promises, &#8220;You shall be fed.&#8221; Fed what? God will meet your needs according to His great and precious promises. God will feed you with the substance of His Word as you do good to read it. Jesus said, &#8220;&#8230; man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.&#8221; He Promises to also fill us with His Holy Spirit as we stay away from being filled by ungodly things. Everything God makes God fills. He made the waters and filled is with marine life; He made the earth and filled it with plant life, animals and humanity. He fed Elijah by Ravens, and He will feed you by His good Hand as well. Only go Him for your daily bread and everlasting water. <\/p>\n<p>Trust Him today, do good as you are trusting, and be fed by the Hand of the Master. To be continued&#8230; <\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, &#8220;Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land, and verily you shall be fed.&#8221; We all want certain things in life.

It was like honeymoon, everything was going on well, prayers were being answered before you even prayed and even after you prayed. You couldn&#8217;t wait to tell friends about the dramatic change in your life. The joy, the happiness, peace was just great. I remember those times in my life. When a baby is born, there is great excitement because of the arrival, the child is fed on baby food, cared for and natured. As time goes by, they begin to teach him different things in preparation for the life a head. Everything he is taught is to make him stronger and stronger to face life and so are the newly weds, the honeymoon gets over and life begins in working on perfecting the marriage.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0There was a certain man who had two sons starting in Luke 15:11, this is the parable of the prodigal son. Here is a son who knows that there is an heritance for him, he knows his father, he knows the heart of his father but he asks for what belongs to him and leaves for a far country, far from home where he cannot encounter with the father and his brother anymore. I see many people who had God present in their lives as their Father but not too long after being blessed, changed, transformed, honeymooned, they took all that they had received and went a far off fleeing from the presence of the Father who loves us all.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Luke 15:14, &#8220;But when he had spent all, there rose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in want&#8221; The problem about withdrawing everything from your account is that it leaves you with nothing. You can only withdraw what has been deposited in your account by either by you or someone else. This young man left with an account fully loaded, a loving father deposited in his account, but he spent it all and then famine hit. The young man thought that with all the goods in his possession, he did not need the father. He made new friends when he had things but remember friends come and go. This is reality, he who has much has many friends but when the things go, friends go too. I need friends the most when the going gets tough and not when I have everything in place. He must have wondered, &#8220;where are all my friends when I need them????&#8221;. How many have been disappointed by friends? There are some things friends will not help you with, not even a brother but our heavenly Father who sticks closer than a brother. He does not leave us, we are the ones who choose to leave Him for the benefits. This young man hit the rock bottom when he found himself taking care of pigs and eating pigs food. Imagine starting from being a son, a wealthy son to feeding pigs and eating pigs food. Desperate people do desperate things, desperate people are humbled. Far from home with nothing and guilty of what he did.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Got to stop for today, are you in the Father&#8217;s house or are you at a far country because you left the Father&#8217;s house? Are you waiting to hit a rock bottom before you make an intelligent decision. Think about your life, where are you with the Father? Isaiah 40:8, &#8220;The grass withers, the flowers fades, But the word of our God stands forever&#8221;, Careers, wealth, friends, positions come and go but God stands forever.<br \/>\n\u00a0Thanks<br

Mind Is Made&nbsp;Up"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Psalm 100:1-5, 1 Make a joyful shout to the LORD, all you lands! 2Serve the LORD with gladness; Come before His presence with singing. 3Know that the LORD, He is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves;[1] We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. 4Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, And into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. 5For the LORD is good; His mercy is everlasting,<\/p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s very important to start your day on a good note, it has a way of affecting your entire day. I tend to be very busy and spent many times but it matters a lot to me how I start my day.<br \/>\n\u00a0We all have a way of affecting how we start the day, it&#8217;s a choice that we&#8217;ve got to make and declare otherwise we become victims of stress, frustrations and lack happiness trying to do what is right. The bible tells us that\u00a0 &#8221; the joy of the Lord is my strength &#8221; . If we take a close look at the word joy, it&#8217;s more than happiness for happiness tend to go with how you feel at a given time especially when everything is going the right way while joy comes when you know that regardless of what you have to deal with whether going forward or backward, you will make it in other words rejoicing in the end result rather than the process. The joy of the Lord make us comfortable in the situations that make other people uncomfortable.<br \/>\nPsalm 100 is a psalm of joy and singing, it starts with make a joyful shout to the Lord. I don&#8217;t have to shout joyfully to be heard by people, I can shout inside and when my inside is affected, my outside appearance will be the result of what is going on inside. Serving the Lord with gladness is awesome for I know that whenever I sit to work at my station, I&#8217;m working and serving the Lord. This is a blessed time where I come in the morning to work and say Lord, I thank you for another opportunity to serve in my department and serve others that I may shine for you at my work place. You see His word says that whatsoever thy hand finds to do, do it with all of you might without murmuring or complaining and the Lord of reward shall reward thee.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Come before His presence with singing. I believe that music is the greatest tool used to uplift. There is nothing I know people respond to like music and that is why we can buy music over and over again, we can have hundreds of music collections. We can listen to music over and over again. The bible says that the Lord inhabits the praises of His people and we do a lot of praises through singing and listening to music. I love music and I can&#8217;t work like I need to without it because the more I praise my Lord through music, the more He energizes me to do my work. You got to give something to get something. A song with you will help you go through the day. When King Saul was being tormented by evil spirits, guess what they did, they had David playing music in his presence and the more he played, the quicker the evil spirit left. Replace your worries and anxieties with a song in your ear.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Enter into His gates with thanksgiving and into His courts with praise. I love this line for this reminds me to go beyond where I am. Entering into His gates and into His courts allows me to leave outside everything that will interfere with my praise while I&#8217;m serving Him everyday. There is power in thanksgiving and when I enter into His gates, I begin to see that He has done more that I need to thank Him for and not always concentrate on what I&#8217;ve got to gain from Him everyday.<br \/>\n\u00a0This is a choice everyone has to make, yes we will have so much on our plates that we need to accomplish and yes we will be dealing with tough customers through the phone but we have been given the power to change the course of the day by allowing the joy of the Lord to be our strength. Keep a song with you, enter His gates and into His courts, refuse anything that will steal your praise, have a thankful heart and joy and be a beacon of light.\u00a0 My mind is made up to start and finish the day well: I&#8217;ve said it, I mean it and I&#8217;m here to represent it!!!!!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Have a joyous day!!!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Thanks<br \/>\n\u00a0Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 100:1-5, 1 Make a joyful shout to the LORD, all you lands! 2Serve the LORD with gladness; Come before His presence with singing. 3Know that the LORD, He is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves;[1] We are His people and the sheep of His pasture. 4Enter [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-556","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-8Y","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/556","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=556"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/556\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=556"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=556"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=556"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":555,"date":"2006-08-23T12:24:29","date_gmt":"2006-08-23T12:24:29","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/08\/23\/there-is-a-guide-part-4\/"},"modified":"2006-08-23T12:24:29","modified_gmt":"2006-08-23T12:24:29","slug":"there-is-a-guide-part-4","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/08\/23\/there-is-a-guide-part-4\/","title":{"rendered":"There Is A Guide, Part&nbsp;4"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Genesis 24:1-66, &#8220;&#8230;you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell; but you shall go to my country and to my family, and take wife for my son Isaac&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0I would like to finish the series we have been looking at, there is so much I could share from the passage but I would like to jump right towards the end and talk about something that can be so scary yet all need it. We have been talking about being guided from what we shouldn&#8217;t do, to what direction to take, what to pray for and to wait and see what the Lord would have for us and this can be seen by the steps of Abraham&#8217;s servant. Abraham &#8216; s servant later met Rebekah &#8216; s family, told them of everything and they also felt this was God &#8216; s leading so they released her to be Isaacs wife.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Genesis 24:62, &#8220;Now Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, &#8230; vs. 63 &#8220;And Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening; and he lifted his eyes and looked, there, the camel were coming&#8221;. vs. 64, &#8220;Then Rebekah lifted her eyes and when she saw Isaac she dismounted from her camel&#8221;. On this verse, Abraham &#8216; s servant is bringing Rebekah to meet her future husband. Isaac is in the field minding his own business, I believe he would come to the field in the evening to meditate fulfilling Psalm 1:2, &#8220;But his delight is in the law of the Lord, And in His law he meditates day and night&#8221;, He must have been meditating on the law of God to give him guidance, not only that, he must have been meditating on the Lord which is having a vertical relationship with the Lord and with time, he looked up and saw Rebekah approaching. We remember how Rebekah on the other hand was busy serving Abraham&#8217;s servant without any agenda and God graciously brings them together while busy serving . The bible says that Isaac and Rebekah both lifted their eyes and saw each other. They were both walking towards each other to meet for the first time. There is a guide when you can patiently wait for the Master to lead you to your right companion while you are busy serving. Many are busy looking that they neglect what they should be doing with their single hood.\u00a0 Contentment leads to fulfillment knowing that God knows and He is in control.\u00a0 Be busy taking care of God&#8217;s business, in due time God will make a way for you. Isaac and Rebekah did not know that some people were working towards bringing them together. It would be a blessing to know that God guided you and I to our right companions. Settle for the best!!!!<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Genesis 24:67, &#8220;The Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah&#8217;s tent; &#8230; and he loved her. My greatest message this morning is the love part which I&#8217;m not going to define according to the worldly way but according to the bible way. When the bible talks about love it defines it this way in 1Corinthians 13:4, &#8220;Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy, love does not parade itself, is not puffed up vs. 5, does not behave rudely, does not seek it&#8217;s own, is not provoked, thinks no evil, vs. 6 does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; vs. 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things endures all things vs. 8 Love never fails&#8221;. How will one learn what love is if th ey do not have a solid vertical relationship?, what we have learned from our Father is what we\u00a0 will execute in our earthly horizontal relationships. Isaac is taking good care of what God has blessed him with for she was the best in Isaac&#8217;s eyes. God has loved us so much that He has shown us what His love is all about and now we can do the same with our wives and husbands, family, companions. Isaac loved Rebekah, meaning he kept all this things that define what love is and I will confidently say that as he was busy serving the Lord, he was being prepared, shaped and channeled to love unconditionally. Love needs work otherwise soon before long it&#8217;s thrown out. Isaac deposited all the qualities of love in Rebekah and Rebekah did the same. Let me say one thing, both of them were not perfect because if you read in the later chapte rs Isaac lied about his wife and his wife helped her son deceive Isaac but Love prevailed.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0For those who are not married and desire to know who God has for them, I want you to remember that there is a guide. God is at work behind the curtains preparing you and your companion to be, be praying and wait patiently watching like Abraham&#8217;s servant to know what God will do. As you pray to God, He will give you guidance through the Holy Spirit on how to specifically pray for your desire. Be busy serving as you get prepared, know that God is in control, don&#8217;t look in the world for your companion, go back and relax in His house among His people and when He does bless you, be faithful to love according to God&#8217;s way. Now I definitely know that there is a guide, thank You Lord for being the guide!!<br \/>\n\u00a0Thanks<br \/>\n\u00a0Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, \u00a0Genesis 24:1-66, &#8220;&#8230;you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell; but you shall go to my country and to my family, and take wife for my son Isaac&#8221; \u00a0I would like to finish the series we have been looking at, there is [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-555","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-8X","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/555","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=555"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/555\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=555"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=555"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=555"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":554,"date":"2006-08-22T12:23:27","date_gmt":"2006-08-22T12:23:27","guid":{"rendered":"http:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/08\/22\/there-is-a-guide-part-3\/"},"modified":"2006-08-22T12:23:27","modified_gmt":"2006-08-22T12:23:27","slug":"there-is-a-guide-part-3","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/08\/22\/there-is-a-guide-part-3\/","title":{"rendered":"There Is A Guide, Part&nbsp;3"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 24:1-66, &#8220;&#8230;you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell; but you shall go to my country and to my family, and take wife for my son Isaac&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Abraham&#8217;s servant was guided not to take a woman from Canaan for Isaac but to go back to Abraham&#8217;s home, family to find a wife for Isaac. Abraham had a vertical relationship with God and with that He could come boldly trust God for what was best for his son.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Genesis 24:12, &#8220;Then he said, &#8220;O Lord God of my master Abraham, please give me success this day and show me kindness to my master Abraham&#8217;s vs. 13, &#8220;Behold I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water, vs. 14, Now let it be that the young woman to whom I say, &#8220;Please let down your pitcher that I may drink&#8221; and she says, &#8220;drink, and I will also give your camel a drink, let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac&#8221;. What an interesting portion of scripture for a vertical relationship with the Lord will cause you to pray for a person whom you can have an horizontal relationship with. Abraham&#8217;s servant was not sure of what was good and acceptable for his master&#8217;s son and so once again, he is guided to pray specifically. I know people are used to praying Lord whatever you want to do, do it and that is good but at the same time the Lord has given us the liberty to ask of Him according to His will. When I have a vertical relationship with the Lord, He reveals to me what His plans are and those become my desires and now I ask according to His will that He may execute it in my life. Mathew 7:7, &#8220;Ask, and it shall be given unto you:&#8230;.&#8221; vs. 8, &#8220;for everyone that asketh receiveth&#8230;&#8221; and this does not mean I can just walk into the kingdom and ask for anything I want, no, I have connection with Him to know what I can ask that in turn\u00a0 He may give. The bible says that we don&#8217;t get because we don&#8217;t ask and many don&#8217;t get because they ask a miss meaning not according to His will. Because the servant was guided, he asked for a specific woman a virtuous woman and his prayer was not selfish, it was a prayer that everyone would want to pray for a companion. Mark 11:24, &#8220;What thingsoever you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them and you shall have them&#8221;. I don&#8217;t see the reason why I cannot come to God, pray specifically for something and allow Him to act on it according to His will?. Peter did it when he said, &#8220;If it&#8217;s You Lord, command me to come to You on water&#8221;. He was specific on what he wanted to do and how he wanted to do it as long as the Lord approved and the Lord said\u00a0 &#8221; come &#8221; , that was approval to the desires of his heart. I saw this with David many times and I choose to be specific with the Lord.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Something I love about this servant is the fact that as he was praying, specific, calm, relaxed, seating down not trying to find himself what he went to look for. I believe that when you have prayed, you patiently wait for the Lord to intervene as to whether what He wants to do will just appear or He will give you divine direction to lead you as to where to go. In this case, he needed to be still and know that God was in control of the situation and God knew who he needed and the Lord made her come to the well at the right time. God in due time will fix things His way without you standing on his way, His timing is always perfect<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Genesis 24:14, &#8220;&#8230; And by this I will know that You have shown me kindness to my master&#8221;,\u00a0 In vs. 15 before he finished praying, Rebekkah appears, a very beautiful woman, a woman of good heart and determination. She is a woman of character, a virtuous woman who fears God, a woman who is walking in the ways pleasing unto God. She has a vertical relationship first even before thinking of a horizontal one. She is out doing her normal business and here she meets a servant and she is kind to him and amazing thing, she does everything the servant prayed to God about.\u00a0 I have a feeling that God had laid in the servant&#8217;s heart exactly what to pray for, He had already provided even before she was revealed to the servant. God knows even before you pray and when you come to Him, you may approach an issue differently but the more you pray, the more He will guide you to pray for it His way and not your way. Could it be possible that the servant could be the type of the Holy Spirit praying on our behalf? Romans 8:26, &#8220;Likewise the Spirit helps our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Sprit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered&#8221;. The Holy Spirit is our guide.

He had one more thing to do before passing into eternity and that was to find his son a wife. He called his servant to explain to him what he requires of him and he makes a vow to follow his master&#8217;s order. Genesis 24:3, &#8220;&#8230;you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell&#8221;. I asked the Lord, what does this mean? Abraham is living in Canaan, a land that flows with milk and honey and yet he does not want his son to marry a woman from Canaan? It&#8217;s very simple, Abraham&#8217;s people and family served the Lord while the Canaanites did not. This applies to us today that the world represents Canaan yet we live in it and the instructions from the Lord, don&#8217;t find someone and have a relationship with who is in the world meaning who is not saved, who is not walking with the Lord for they have no vertical relationship.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0When horizontal relationship is not defined by the vertical one, it tends to make things complicated by that I mean, for example, if you marry someone who is not saved, when you have kids, by whose standards and life style will they be brought up the saved or unsaved? See anything the Lord tells us is for our own benefit and in as much as we might try and do it in another way, it will not work. It&#8217;s very easy to be attracted and want to have a relationship with someone who is not saved and may even think of it as an evangelistic date but most of the time it doesn&#8217;t work out. 2Corinthians 6:14, &#8220;Do not be unequally yoked with the unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? A believer lives under grace and keeps the law in mind but the unbeliever could care less for he or she has no standards to live by and so what is right for you may not be right for them and what is wrong for you may not necessarily be wrong for them why? because you have a vertical relationship they don&#8217;t have. Someone said, &#8220;Be busy serving the Lord and moving forward and while in that process, you will look on your side one day and you will see someone busy serving the Lord. The neat thing, both of you will be heading towards the same direction&#8221;. Those who have no vertical relationship will have no reason to walk towards the same direction in which you are going. But when both parties who would like to be in a relationship have both vertical relationship, they can cultivate a good horizontal relationship.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Genesis 24:4, &#8220;but you shall go to my country and to my family and take a wife for my son Isaac&#8221;, Not only is the servant told what not to do, he has been given another instruction which is a good one as to where to find someone for Abraham&#8217;s son,\u00a0 &#8221; go back to my people &#8221; . What does this mean to us, go back to my people called by my name, people who serve me, look up to me, who have been washed, whose sins have been covered. I&#8217;m glad to know that in our churches today there are many young people who have a vertical relationship with the Father and the Father is willing to help them develop horizontal relationship in due time. This is what I call a crucified life for vertical and horizontal presents the cross reflected in Galatians 2:20, &#8220;For I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I but Christ liveth in me, and now the life which I now I live in the flesh I live by faith of the Son of God, who gave Himself for me&#8221;. Christ is the definition of love and so what He has presented to me through a vertical relationship, I can do the same horizontally.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0For those who have prayed for a mate and a times felt you were denied or did not qualify or it was taking too long, just know, the blessing may be delayed but not denied.

We have been created by the Master for the Master that we may continually have a relationship with Him. Every other good things we do while we are on earth are benefits from above. What we do while we are here on earth has nothing to do with our main reason and purpose in this life. This is what I call a vertical relationship for all your affections, love, service goes back to the one who brought us into this world as His children for a purpose. Yet as a people who have gone a stray, He has demonstrated His love towards us by sending His Son Jesus to redeem us or to say to buy us back at a price. Soon He is coming back as the groom and so the bride ought to\u00a0 ready for the coming of the groom. Christ defines to us what marriage is all about for as He is the ready groom preparing His bride for His coming.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Vertical relationship teaches us a lot about life and what it&#8217;s all about that ultimately we may\u00a0 practice and fulfill what He began in heaven. My dad says, &#8220;Marriages are made in heaven but they are perfected here on earth&#8221; in other words, it&#8217;s worked on, fixed, natured, prepared, shaped, cared for down here. You cannot expect what you&#8217;ve not sowed. You cannot withdraw what you have not deposited. Some call it a quit because they came into a relationship with full account. As they began to withdraw from each other &#8216; s account, they did not take time to deposit to keep those accounts running healthy. When all the withdrawal was done, there was absolutely nothing to keep them together. You deposit love, you can withdraw it.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Anyway that is not my message but it will strengthen some of the things that I will be sharing. There are certain things the Holy Spirit tipped me on many years ago I would like to share with you and maybe this can help you. I am not an expert in talking about this topic and that goes with the rest of the messages but with observation, experience and the help of God, I believe someone will see something\u00a0 they can apply to their life. You don&#8217;t have to agree with me on everything.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Be blessed.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0* I feel there are people who have burning questions looking for answers, well you are welcome to ask Pastor Phil and I.

This may have been their occupation all their life. They knew fish seasons and where to fish so they are experts. On this particular night, they are out fishing as always only to catch nothing all night long. Morning comes and the men are disappointed and all they can do is wash their nets. What a night!!!!!, many at the market are waiting for the fish, they need to make money, they need to feed their families. \u00a0I can imagine them pondering over what they will tell the people. In simple, their normal, daily routine had been interrupted, brought to a halt. Have you ever be at a place where everything you knew how to do at your job or at home all of a sudden was interrupted and those looking up to you were disappointed in you? Hang on, help is on the way.<\/p>\n<p>Romans 8:28, &#8220;And we know that all things work together for good&#8230;.&#8221; Jesus shows up in the situation teaching the word of God. He has great multitude listening to Him teach. Great thing about Him, He comes right when there is a need. In as much as people need a touch from Him, every one has a different need and my need may not be yours. He sees a boat and desires to use it maybe as a pulpit to preach. Peter is asked to move the boat closer to the shore and he is faithful to do it though disappointed by the previous night. Jesus wants to do something big and so He prepares everyone by teaching them, It is not mentioned to us as to what He was teaching on I will guess &#8220;faith&#8221;. Peter must have been listening carefully for the bible says in Rom 10:17, &#8220;&#8230; faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord&#8221;. After Jesus did the Kingdom&#8217;s work, He tells Peter to launch into the deep, meaning cast his nets again in the same place he had tried fishing last night. Listen to his response &#8220;Master we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your Word, I will let down the net&#8221;. It&#8217;s easier to hear the word, try another place but to try the same place???. Yes you might have tried surviving in the same job and you already lost hope and instead of Him telling you to move on, He tells you to cast your nets again. You may have applied for a promotion and nothing has come through because of frustrations, instead of Him telling you to move out, He is telling you to cast your nets again in the same position. It&#8217;s not about what we know, what we can do or qualified to do, it&#8217;s about what God can do when we can&#8217;t do it. It&#8217;s being obedient to the word of God to the point where you do as He has said regardless of what you know. It may never make sense but the key word is &#8221; be obedient&#8221;. After all, many things that God say don&#8217;t make sense and if you tried to make sense out of them, you will never amount to anything because while you are busy making sense out of them, your blessings will be passing you by.<\/p>\n<p>Peter&#8217;s faithfulness causes him to make the biggest catch in his history of fishing. He begins to call on his friends to come out and help pull the nets which proves Pro 10:22, &#8220;The blessings of the Lord maketh rich and adds no sorrows with it&#8221;. The blessings of the Lord overtakes as the bible continues to say &#8220;try me and see if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour you out blessings that you will not have enough room to contain all of them&#8221;. What I&#8217;m I saying this morning? YOUR PLACE OF MISERY COULD BE YOUR PLACE OF BLESSINGS, but you have to have the faith and take Him at His word cause surely His word shall not return void. Had Peter explained how professional he was, and how he had done this for many years and refused just to apply the simply instruction, the blessing would have passed him by.<\/p>\n<p>If God still gives you grace to be able to deal with something that you really would like to give up on, keep on standing and launching out in the deep, you have come too far to go back, you have gone too deep to fail.<\/p>\n<p>* By the way, join me in praying for the peace of Jerusalem, that&#8217;s a command from the bible<br \/>\nThanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Luke 5:1-11, &#8220;&#8230;Master we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your Word, I will let down the net&#8221; Peter and his friends are professional fishermen.

He loved them, cared for them and wanted to protect them. He even went a head to show them a picture of what will happen they have a king 1Samuel 8:10, &#8220;&#8230; This will be the behavior of the king who will reign over you&#8221;, read it for yourself and you will see terrible things the king would do to them if they insisted on having one. Amazing thing, even with the warning, they still refused. vs. 19, &#8220;Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, &#8220;No, but we will have a king over us, vs. 20, &#8220;that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles&#8221;. We have been warned some relationships will ruin our lives by killing our morale to serve the Lord, will put us in compromising situations, will lead us to wrong places, will kill the anointing in our lives yet at times we still insist that we want it. Certain jobs and positions will make us stop praying, depending on God, going to church, stunt our growth, yet we insist that we want it. According to the word of God, we have been shown what will happen if we step out of HIS WILL and because of the hardness of heart we still want to do it any way. I know many do it out of fear of being left out or rejected, but why pray then &#8220;Your kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven&#8221;. PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO LET GO OF A THEN THAT THEY MAY HAVE A NOW and it&#8217;s because they cannot believe God enough to say &#8220;Lord if I let go this, I know you can bring that&#8221; and so when we allow them into our lives, Jesus might still be the Savior of our lives but not the Lord of our lives. Whoever or whatever you have allowed in your life becomes now the king of your life and God is left out of the picture. We know of how Saul the king the Israelites cried for did when he came to power, everything they were warned of was manifested and while talking about that, how about Samson who was told not to be involved or even marry any woman from Philistine, he insisted and therefore he was permitted to marry and yet we know how he ended his life.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a great listener of my earthly father&#8217;s counsel. Through his Christ like life, experience and wisdom, every big thing I want to do I pass it by him to get his wisdom and blessing, and every time he has given me a picture of the situation I had not seen. With that I have been able to make some better judgments, permitted and approved. I saw that he was like Samuel mediating between God and the Israelites. I even leant from there that what I thought I wanted may have not been necessarily what I needed. We need to surround ourselves with godly Father figures who can counsel us. I believe we can save ourselves a lot of heartaches if we listen to their counsel for the bible says, <a><\/a>Proverbs 11:14 ,&#8221;Where there is no counsel, the people fall; But in the multitude of counselors there is safety&#8221;. If you get counsel and you insist on going the opposite, the counselor may not stop you, the road you are heading may at one point stop you. Let&#8217;s listen to wise counsel that we may make good judgments permitted and approved. It&#8217;s for our own good.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, 1Samuel 8:7, &#8220;And the Lord said to Samuel, &#8220;Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them In the story about the prodigal son, we see a son who insisted on having [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-550","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-8S","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/550","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=550"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/550\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=550"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=550"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=550"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":525,"date":"2006-07-07T16:16:06","date_gmt":"2006-07-07T16:16:06","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/07\/07\/doing-what-you%e2%80%99ve-heard-by-pastor-phil\/"},"modified":"2006-07-07T16:16:06","modified_gmt":"2006-07-07T16:16:06","slug":"doing-what-you%e2%80%99ve-heard-by-pastor-phil","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/07\/07\/doing-what-you%e2%80%99ve-heard-by-pastor-phil\/","title":{"rendered":"Doing What You\u2019ve Heard by Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cDo not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 23 Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror 24 and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like. 25 But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it\u2014he will be blessed in what he does.\u201d  James 1:22 &#8211; 25<\/p>\n<p>Do you enjoy learning about God\u2019s word?  Isn\u2019t it great to listen to preaching that helps you to comprehend God\u2019s Word more clearly?  There are some people that just seem to be able to break down the Word of God in such a masterful way.  I have learned many things throughout my years as a Christian from others.  There are particular people in my life that have helped me to learn about a particular spiritual discipline, or a certain biblical truth or principle, ect\u2026.  Why is it that there is so much learning of truth, but so little doing of truth?  We learn very much, and appropriate so very little.  We learn how to pray, but then do we actually pray?  We learn how to study God\u2019s Word, but then are too busy to study it.  We learn how to share our faith, but then walk by thousands of people, never sharing God\u2019s truth with those that are Hell-bound.  James (the bother of Jesus) wrote that listening to God\u2019s Word is not enough.  James said about God\u2019s Word:<\/p>\n<p>1.     \u201cDo what it says.\u201d  If we only listen to God\u2019s Word, whether listening to a preacher or listening to God Himself and we don\u2019t do it we deceive ourselves.  Do you know that failing to do God\u2019s Word after you have heard it shows that you are deceiving yourself.  <\/p>\n<p>2.      Don\u2019t forget what you look like.  James uses the illustration of one that stands in front of a mirror and looks at oneself, but then walks away and forgets what one looks like.  Imagine if one checked oneself in the mirror and was on their way to an interview.  This person had all kinds of stains on their clothing, but off to the interview he went.  This person saw what he looked like in the mirror, but then seemed to forget what he looked like, because he didn\u2019t do anything (clean his stain, or change his clothing) to make a change.  Yet so many do this with God\u2019s Word, looking into it as a mirror, seeing the change that needs to take place, and going on without making the change.<\/p>\n<p>3.      The blessing comes to those that are doers of His Word.  James says that the one that looks into the Word of God intently (carefully, with purpose) and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it \u2013 he will be blessed in what he does.  Are you deceived, have you forgotten what you look like (what His Word says), or are you doing what God is speaking to you.  What is God speaking to you?  Write it down, and then do it.  If you need help appropriating speak to a mature believer, or a spiritual leader.  You can always write Evan and I for help, and we would be glad to help if we can.  Christianity today has much learning, but little application.  Be the type of Christian that Jesus wants you to be, one that does His Word.  <\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessing Pastor Phil <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cDo not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves.

Mt 7:25 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. Mt 7:26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. Mt 7:27 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.\u201d  (Matthew 7:24 \u2013 27)<\/p>\n<p>I have a great friend named Joe Bukoweicki that built houses.  If you were to ask him what the most important thing on a house is, he would tell you the foundation.  A house is only as strong as the foundation that it is built upon.  Jesus uses this language of foundations when he speaks in Matt 7.  Jesus shares that there are two kinds of builders (people), those that have built their lives upon the solid foundation of Christ the rock, and those that have built their house upon the unstable foundation of religious sand.  <\/p>\n<p>Have you ever seen those incredible sculptures of sand art?  Click to check it out. <a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=sand+art&#038;ndsp=20&#038;svnum=10&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;start=60&#038;sa=N\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=sand+art&#038;ndsp=20&#038;svnum=10&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;start=60&#038;sa=N<\/a> There is so much time that goes in the aesthetics, but it can be easily destroyed because it still is only sand.  There are many that build their lives upon the shifting sands of religion, and tradition.  However Jesus said of those that do this, that they are foolish.  The reason for there foolishness is because although they heard the Words of Jesus, not the words of a religious leader, but Christ, they refused to put them into practice.  It is not hearing but doing that shows a true convert.  The foolish man was the one who heard the sayings of Jesus, but did not obey them. It\u2019s not the world that hears the sayings of Jesus and doesn\u2019t obey them. Most know only the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d and \u201cJudge not,\u201d and even then their understanding is darkened. However, the Church is filled with false converts who sit among God\u2019s people and hear His words, but don\u2019t obey them. They build their house on sand rather than on the firm foundation of Jesus Christ and His words (Ray Comfort).\u201d A. W. Tozer said, \u201cIt is my opinion that tens of thousands of people, if not millions, have been brought into some kind of religious experience by accepting Christ, and they have not been saved.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The true convert builds his house upon the rock. \u201cHe is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he. (Deut.32:4).  Paul wrote \u201c\u2026and that rock was Christ (1 Corinthians 10:4).\u201d  <a href=\"http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=foundation+%2B+house&#038;svnum=10&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/images.google.com\/images?q=foundation+%2B+house&#038;svnum=10&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The test will show the foundation!  Jesus said that the rain will come down, the streams will rise, and the winds will blow and beat against that house (the sand house, and the rock house).  The rain of tribulation, the streams of temptation, and the winds of persecution will beat against your life.  If Christ is not your foundation, you will fall with a great crash; ultimately Hell will be the place you \u201ccrash\u201d for eternity.  Don\u2019t build your house on religion, or tradition, Jesus has made this abundantly clear.  If you do you are playing Russian roulette with a fully loaded gun!  If Christ is who you have built your house upon, His words alone, not the words of a pastor, priest, tradition, creed, or culture, then Christ will protect you.

Allow it to minister to you, and please share it with others.<\/p>\n<p>Many times when \u201cbad\u201d things happen to \u201cgood\u201d people, the first thing that is said about the situation is \u201cThat\u2019s just not fair!\u201d or \u201cSuch and Such was a good person.\u201d But you know what? We won\u2019t get it. It\u2019s not our place to try and figure out God\u2019s reasoning behind letting something \u201cbad\u201d happen to a \u201cgood\u201d person.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways\u201d, says the Lord. \u201cFor as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts\u201d Isaiah 55:8-9 NJKV<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know about you but the last time I checked the earth was pretty far from heaven. Since this is the case, we cannot possibly completely understand God\u2019s thoughts. And you\u2019ll just get a headache trying to force the issue.<\/p>\n<p>Did you know that the word \u2018Fair\u2019 is never used in the Bible to describe God\u2019s character? \u2018Fair\u201d appears only as a description for beauty. Now \u2018Just\u201d on the other hand is used over 50 times to describe God. When something is fair, it is limited by our own experiences thereby justifying the event\/action. When something is just, it is justified by God\u2019s understanding.<\/p>\n<p>God\u2019s justice may not make a lot of sense to us, but know that He makes it all work out in the end, because He has seen it all from beginning to end.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd we know that all things work together for the good of those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose\u201d Romans 8:28 NJKV<\/p>\n<p>To close I would like to share a thought in light of Lisette\u2019s wonderful message. There is no place more clear to deal with the issue of justice and fairness than looking to the cross of Calvary. If God were merely fair, was it fair to allow His sinless Son to die for sinful, undeserving people? If ever a man could say, \u201cit\u2019s not fair,\u201d it would have been Jesus Christ. It wasn\u2019t fair for Him to go to the cross for you, or for me. Yet, \u201cWhile we were yet sinners Christ died for us.\u201d It is to our benefit that He is not fair, because we would all end up in Hell, because there is no one good, no not even one Jesus said as He spoke to the rich young ruler. \u201cWhy do you call me good?\u201d Jesus answered. \u201cNo one is good\u2014except God alone (Mark 10:18).\u201d This man called Jesus good, apart from calling Him God, and only God is good. In civil law, a good judge must punish crime. If he turns a blind eye to injustice, then he is corrupt and he himself should be punished. &#8220;Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; mercy and truth go before your face&#8221; (Psalm 89:14). God is rich in mercy to all that call upon him &#8220;But God, who is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us&#8230;&#8221; (Ephesians 2:4). Eternal life is in Jesus Christ, that is why Jesus said, \u201c&#8221;He who hears My word and believes on Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life&#8221; (John 5:24). \u201cIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).\u201d \u201cWe know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands (1 John 2:3).\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,This morning\u2019s word will come from a friend of Pastor Phil\u2019s, Lisette.

Some take it a step further and use Romans 10:9 which Paul writes, \u201cThat if you confess with your mouth, \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. If one quoted this verse alone as the means of salvation, then it sounds like Paul is saying all one must do is to confess sin, believe Jesus and salvation is bestowed. However the key in this whole thing is Jesus is Lord. This confession was made publicly among other disciples. Then this new convert was disciple into Christian maturity.<\/p>\n<p>When the Apostle Paul was on his way to kill Christians Christ met him on the road to Damascus and \u201c\u2026suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:? 4 ?And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?? 5 ?And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.? 6 ?And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Did Paul confess Jesus as Lord, yes. Did he believe in his heart, yes. Did he tremble with conviction of his sin, yes. Jesus confronted him with the Law, the sixth commandment, \u201cthou shall not murder,\u201d for that in fact was what Paul was doing to Christians. After this conversion took place Paul said to Jesus, \u201cLord, what wilt thou have me to do.\u201d Paul seemed to instantly know that he must now be a doer of God\u2019s word and not simply one that hears, believes and confesses Jesus as Lord. Now he would have to live under the Lordship of Jesus Christ from this day forward.<\/p>\n<p>The problem in many churches today is that preaching takes place, the pastor has people close their eyes and repeat a prayer of confession for sin after him. Then many times the person\u2019s life does not change, and many times the person doesn\u2019t return to the church even for a second visit. We call this type of person a false convert, because they have made stake to claims of salvation unto Jesus, but they wanted a Savior but not Lord. However the two cannot be separated, Jesus is Savior and Lord of my life.<\/p>\n<p>In light of this, in the above key Scripture verse, Jesus spoke to the Jews who had believed Him. Therefore belief in Jesus was already present. Jesus then went on to say, \u201cIf you hold to my teaching, then you are my disciples indeed.\u201d This is called a conditional statement because it uses IF and THEN, meaning IF you do this, THEN this will be the result. However IF one does not do this, THEN one will not get the same result. Jesus said one must continue in His word. The Expositors Bible Commentary says, \u201cReceiving his teaching would mark them as genuine disciples and would lead them into a deeper experience of truth.\u201d This learned truth then, would liberate from legalism, superstition, and dead works of tradition which had developed over the years. Jesus felt the necessity of making perfectly clear the conditions of discipleship.<\/p>\n<p>Are you reading the Scriptures daily (continuing in His Word)? Are you obeying what you reading and showing Him to be Lord over your life? If you are then you are His disciple, you know the truth and have been set free, therefore REJOICE!

In light of that Jesus speaks again about another mark being his disciple. Jesus starts off by talking about receiving Him.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Whoever receives a disciple receives Christ. Those who treat His disciples bad, treat Jesus bad. Remember when the Apostle Paul, formally called Saul, was persecuting Christians? Jesus showed up on the road to Damascus, knocked him down and said, \u201cSaul, Saul we do you persecute Me [Jesus].\u201d It was clear from the lips of Christ that those who come against Christ\u2019s disciples are coming against Jesus, and those that receive His disciples, welcome Christ.<\/li>\n<li>Whoever receives Jesus receives God. God was the One that send Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. Many Jewish people, and others as well, want to reject Jesus but receive God. This simply can\u2019t take place because Jesus is God. \u201cPhilip said, \u201cLord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.\u201d Jn 14:9 Jesus answered: \u201cDon\u2019t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.\u201d Jesus also said to the Pharisees, \u201c\u2019I tell you the truth,\u2019 Jesus answered, \u2018before Abraham was born, I am!\u2019 At this, they picked up stones to stone him,\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Whoever gives a cup of cold water to the little ones is Christ\u2019s disciple. Jesus is the living water that brings satisfaction to the thirsty. He said, \u201cEveryone who drinks this water [natural physical water] will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst, and \u201cIf anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. 38 Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him.\u201d In context of the prophet\u2019s reward, and the righteous man\u2019s rewards, there is the disciples reward here. Those that refresh Christ\u2019s disciples will not loose their reward. Disciples of course have the living water in them, but even they need to be refreshed. The reason Jesus said that those who drink of the living water will NEVER thirst again is because the source will never run dry. Abraham\u2019s well could run dry (John 4), but Christ\u2019s well can never run dry, because His well has always been full to overflowing with eternal life sustaining water. Will you share that water with another disciple today and so refresh their spirit. Please pray, encourage, and minister to at least one before the day is through. As God uses you to bring His living water to others, He will make sure you too are filled.

Perhaps is one wears a teams clothing, jersey, hat, etc\u2026. However if I put on a NY Yankee jersey does that mean that I am on the NY Yankees? Of course not! How then can one know if one is a disciple of Christ? Well one way to know Jesus said is that His disciples would have love one to another. This sounds very quaint, loving, caring, and mushy. Love as many have said is perhaps the most abused word in language. Jesus spoke to His disciples and gave them a new commandment, and that was to love one another as Jesus had loved them. Many feel that the love Jesus was speaking of here, is the demonstration of love that Jesus had shown them up to this point He was speaking to them. Jesus had shown them love, but He did not display His greatest act of love at the time He was instructing them to love on another. That display would be shown at the cross. Jesus would die for His twelve and for the whole world. This was the love that He was commanding them to love one another with. He said a new command, not a new idea, suggestion, or option I give you, but a new command. Jesus further said, \u201cGreater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.\u201d Jesus was calling them to lay their lives down for one another. When is the reason that Jesus wanted His disciples to love one another as He had loved them?<\/p>\n<p>Christ\u2019s Love is pure. John wrote, \u201cHow great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!\u201d God is the source of love, and He lavishes that love upon His children as a mother lavishes love upon her child. His pure love, not love as the world gives, needed to be in their hearts if they were going to be Christ-like.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Christ\u2019s Love is demonstrative. The world sits in condemnation and judgment. The world is guilty of breaking God\u2019s Law, they love the darkness and hate the light. Jesus said that when His disciples shine their love toward one another, that the world would see it and know who Christ\u2019s disciples are. The world can only see this kind of love if Christians step out of the four walls of the church building and live it out among all men. Many non-Christians have seen televangelists manipulate people for their money. Christ didn\u2019t die in a church, He died in plain view of the people, in the sight of all men. Oh that we would die to ourselves that He would live in us, and we would be His feet and hands extended. I laugh when people say I love God, it\u2019s the church I have a problem with. That is like saying I love you but I hate your husband or wife. Husbands and wives are one, and so is Christ and His body. His body must love one another, the church needs that love to flourish, and the world needs to see it as a living tangible witness.<\/li>\n<li>Christ\u2019s Love is evidential evidence. Jesus said \u201c\u2026by this all men will know that you are my disciples\u2026.\u201d When you live his love out loud, it shows that Jesus is real. Why would go out of your way to help, give, bless, provide, even sacrifice for another brother or sister in Christ, because Christ is real. Why would you display the fruit of the spirit, bless those who persecute you, love your enemies? Practical Christian lives points to the reality that Christ is real, and the Savior of the world. Demonstrate his pure love today as evidence that Jesus is Savior, Lord, and soon and coming King!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Until the nets are filled\u2026Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n<p>* For the next two weeks, Pastor Phil will be doing devotions in my absence.

Betrayal (By Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>&quot;Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall betray me. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I? (Matt. 26:20 &#8211; 22)<\/p>\n<p>At the Last Supper Jesus is eating with His twelve and speaks about betrayal. This is perhaps the worst gesture that a &quot;friend&quot; can do to another friend, even worse then death, because one has to live with the fact that betrayal meant a complete hardening of the heart in the midst of the relationship. Jesus makes the statement that one of his &quot;friends&quot; there would deny him, and when He said this everyone of the disciples became sorrowful and looked introspectively saying &quot;Lord is it I?&quot; No one pointed fingers at Judas as if he had a big hook nose and devilish horns coming out of his head. The Scriptures point out that two of the disciples went against Jesus at His hour of need. Peter denied Jesus and Judas betrayed Jesus, so what&#39;s the difference, or are they the same?<\/p>\n<p>Well let&#39;s look at Peter first. Jesus says to the group that &quot;all you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.&quot; Peter answered and said to him, &quot;Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet will I never be offended.&quot; Jesus responded by saying to him, &quot;&#8230;this night, before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.&quot; Peter said to him, &quot;Though I should die with you, yet will I not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.&quot; Peter really meant to keep his word, but when he was tested he folded under pressure three times just as Jesus said. We know that later is Peter&#39;s life he got things together and became a leader among the Apostles and wrote two books of the Bible bearing his name.<\/p>\n<p>Judas on the other hand turned against Jesus a bit differently. &quot;Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, And said to them, What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.&quot; Judas was plotting and scheming behind the scenes with those that wanted to see the destruction of Christ, and the disbanding of his disciples. Those evil men used Judas as a pawn to work an inside job on Jesus. While in prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, Judas comes with his entourage of chief priests and armed soldiers. &quot;And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. And Jesus said to him, Friend, wherefore are you come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.&quot; Jesus calls him friend and yet Judas still sells him out in betrayal. With friends like Judas who needs enemies?<\/p>\n<p>Peter grabbed his sword when they laid hold of Jesus and cut of one of the soldier&#39;s ears to defend the Lord. He was showing his seriousness of protecting Jesus at all costs, even death. After Peter&#39;s denial the Scriptures says that Peter &quot;went out and wept bitterly [in repentance], showing himself a true convert.&quot; Judas however felt the guilt of betraying Jesus for thirty pieces of silver and tried to give it back, admitting that he had sinned against innocent blood, and he threw the coins down at the feet of the priests and went forth and hung himself. Both men felt sorrow for their sin, but Peter repented while Judas did not and committed suicide, showing himself to be a false convert.<\/p>\n<p>Application: If you find your actions plotting against your relationship with Jesus, repent right away, because the Judas that lives in us tries to rise up and take charge. If you have denied Jesus by your life in anyway also repent and move on and do great things for your Lord. Remember your faith MUST stand trial, so that it can be refined.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&quot;Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.

While non-believers will be judged in righteousness, Christians will be judged on their works unto the Lord. Are you ready for such a Day? Paul reminds us of the urgency of being ready for this test on God&#39;s calendar.<\/li>\n<li>The Fire Will Reveal All! What is the result when one burns up wood, hay, and straw? Ashes. However, what happens when gold, silver and precious stones are burned up? The dross (the impurities) surface until all that remains is the pure precious metal. It was the valuable metals and precious stones (Rev 21:18-21) that were used to adorn ancient temples. Are not we too the temple of God (1 Cor. 2:12)? The fire is not testing the quantity built rather the quality of what you are made of, and the fire won&#39;t lie, but will reveal!<\/li>\n<li>Giving a worthy Gift to Christ. What do you desire to lie down at the feet of your Lord and Savior, ashes or precious metals? We only have this one life to live. This is why Christ Himself commands &quot;But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven&#8230;For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.&quot; Will your face be shining in the precious metals you lay at Christ&#39;s feet, or will your face be saddened in the ashes of temporal works? I believe many will be saddened knowing that they could have stored up the gifts He desired. Examine what you are made of; remember the Day is coming when the fire will reveal all. Give Him a worthy gift, one that He sees not only your reflection in, but more importantly His reflection!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1Co 3:12 If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, 1Co 3:13 his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light.

Jesus seemed to run into that situation often, even though He was a Master communicator. Jesus had just finished having a conversation with the women at the well, when his disciples were approaching with lunch. His disciples &quot;were surprised to find him talking with a woman.&quot; It was considered improper for a Rabbi to speak with women in public, let alone one that was sexually immoral. The disciples see the women leave, and see her water bucket that she left as evidence of her presence, and not &quot;just their imaginations.&quot; But no one asked, &#39;What do you want?&#39; or &#39;Why are you talking with her?&#39; I believe, that although no one asked those questions, those were the questions that they had on their minds.<\/p>\n<p>His disciples have these questions, but didn&#39;t dare ask them. Therefore, what do men do when they don&#39;t want to speak about what is really on their minds? They eat! Eating doesn&#39;t take much brain power, similar to watching TV. They urged Jesus, &quot;Rabbi, eat something.&quot; Jesus however knowing their thoughts replies, &quot;I have food to eat that you know nothing about.&quot; Now they are thinking that someone came and gave Jesus food. Jesus continues by saying, &quot;My food,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.&quot; Now they were really thrown off. What was Jesus getting at, because they were talking about food, but Jesus wasn&#39;t talking about food, He was talking about FOOD! What was this food?<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The fulfillment Jesus just has with ministering to the lost women.<\/li>\n<li>The overall life mission of reconciling the world to the Father through Himself as the bridge.<\/li>\n<li>The sustenance of pleasing His Father by obeying the mission that He gave Jesus to live out.<\/li>\n<li>The very hunger He possessed, they did not yet crave, and that is being salt to make sinners thirsty for the water that the women received.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>What was the work Jesus was to finish? Just as drinking from the well would cause the women to thirst again, so too will the disciples hunger again if their food source was from town supermarket. The women needed the living water, and the disciples needed the bread of life, and the desire to seek and save the lost just as Jesus had. When the women was filled with the water of life she began to bring others to Jesus, and that is what Jesus was looking for in His Twelve. &quot;Do you not say, &#39;Four months more and then the harvest&#39;? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest. 36 Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together. 37 Thus the saying &#39;One sows and another reaps&#39; is true. 38 I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.&quot; Jesus wanted the eyes of the disciples opened to the fields, NOT to their &quot;food!&quot; Job said, &quot;I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.&quot; Jesus said told you and me to seek and save the lost. When we obey God in this, we too will eat the food that many do not know of. Are you hungry? Go to the harvest fields of your schools and jobs, and finish the work by the power of the Holy Spirit, and be fed by obeying His will!<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&quot;But he said to them, &quot;I have food to eat that you know nothing about.&quot; &quot;My food,&quot; said Jesus, &quot;is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.&quot; (John 4:32,34) Have you ever tried to share something with someone and they just didn&#39;t comprehend what you were saying?

This man did not sow bad seeds but good seeds. The moment we accept Christ, we sow good seeds in the field that He has prepared, our hearts. The word of God is a seed partially because in John 12:24, &quot;tells us that unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone but if it dies, it will be able to bare much fruit&quot;. Jesus was the seed that died and we are a result of the seed that died. Once again we see a man who sowed good seeds not in anyone&#39;s field but his field. Everything was okay as he natured that seed, dug around it, watered it and watched over it. Actually this is how a Christian life ought to be a life of working hard to maintain that which is planted in us.<\/p>\n<p>Prov 4:23, &quot;Keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life&quot;, this is one of my favorite scripture verses. In the process of time, the sower fell a sleep and stopped watching over his sowed seeds. If we were to look at it from our point of view, he stopped praying, stopped reading the word, stopped going to church and mixing up with the believers. He took off the whole armor of God, threw down his sword, stopped fighting sin, I don&#39;t care spirit came in, started wondering why he came to Christ in the first place and some. The enemy came in and planted doubt, fear, hatred, confusion, lack of patience and many things. We are told to keep our hearts with all diligence meaning guard our heart at all times for that is where the issues of life flow from. We are told to protect the seed at all cost, fight for the seed, so as not to allow the enemy to plant weeds in our lives. Have you been guarding the seed like you should or are you sleeping on the job, the reason the enemy is planting weeds in your life.<\/p>\n<p>I have slept on the job a couple of times and boy the enemy planted the wrong things, the moment I began to guard the precious seed, watered it, natured it, cherished it and fought for it, the enemy had a tough time trying to place a foot into my heart. The moment I went to sleep, he was running the show. He bound me again in grave clothes and I had no strength to fight back and I became a victim. The sleep does not just happen, it starts with something small like sitting down and then progresses to something new and before you know it, you are way gone. It&#39;s very hard to tell when you went to sleep but good thing is that we can wake up from the sleep. Hebrews 12:1, &quot;The night is far spent and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast aside the works of darkness and let us put on the armor or light&quot;.

Sometimes it makes us so happy but just saying &quot;thank you, I really appreciate your help&quot;. When we can do it so easily and naturally without any effort, to people around us, it is even more easier for us to keep letting the Lord know how much we are thankful to Him for every little act He is performing in our lives. And later It would become so difficult for us to just sit and keep receiving everything from Him and not letting Him know how much that meant to us. We develop an attitude of gratitude.<\/p>\n<p>David is a perfect example to us for the way he gave thanks to the Lord for just anything and everything. He would just say &quot;Give thanks to the Lord for He is good and his love endures forever&quot; as in Psalms 118:1 and 107:1, simply giving thanks for His goodness. If we like a person, whenever we get a chance to meet him or her we just let them know how nice they are or how happy we are to meet them, or appreciate them in something or the other, its just a human reflex. Likewise David used to just keep on praising and thanking the Lord for his unfailing and everlasting love, his kindness, his mercy, his grace.<\/p>\n<p>Paul is another person from who teaches us how to be grateful to God in everything. as he says in 1 Thess 5:18 &#8211; &quot;Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God&#39;s will for you in Christ Jesus&quot;. this answers two of our questions &#8211; when do we give thanks and the basic reason why we need to give thanks. So whenever we seek God&#39;s will in our lives for anything we should always remember that His will for us is also to give Him thanks in everything . No condition in this world is so bad where there is nothing to give thanks for. Now lets look at some reasons for telling Jesus &quot;Thank You&quot;, we shall look into just three reasons out of the many, today.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Thanks for bread: In our every day walk in life we as usual thank the Lord for the food we eat. Jesus himself thanked the Father in heaven before he broke the bread as in 1 Corinth 11:24. We see Paul giving thanks for the bread in Acts 27.35.<\/li>\n<li>Thanks for eternal life through Jesus Christ: This is God&#39;s indescribable gift to us which no man can give unto us and that makes us special children of the Most High God. As in 2 Corinth 9:17 we should give thanks unto the Lord for his gratitude.<\/li>\n<li>Thanks for the victory over death: Death is something common man is afraid of, but we know that if we die her eon earth, we get to live with Him in Heaven. 1 Corinth 15: 35 to 58 explains very clearly the Resurrection Body. A very powerful teacher of the word once explained that when a bee stings once, it loses its second sting, so it becomes harmless after the first sting. All it can do is buzz around you and scare you but this time you know that it is not going to harm you. Likewise Jesus took that sting of death for us so it is not going to affect us anymore nor scare us. Death can only buzz around us but it is powerless to hurt us. So we see another reason to thank Him for His victory over death. As in 1 Corinth 15:55 and 56, &quot;Where O death is your victory? where O death is your sting?&quot;.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You can find so many reasons to thank the Lord. Its a never ending list.

The word of God is a seed partially because in John 12:24, &#8220;tells us that unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone but if it dies, it will be able to bare much fruit&#8221;. Jesus was the seed that died and we are a result of the seed that died. Once again we see a man who sowed good seeds not in anyone&#8217;s field but his field. Everything was okay as he natured that seed, dug around it, watered it and watched over it. Actually this is how a Christian life ought to be a life of working hard to maintain that which is planted in us. <\/p>\n<p>Prov 4:23, &#8220;Keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life&#8221;, this is one of my favorite scripture verses. In the process of time, the sower fell a sleep and stopped watching over his sowed seeds. If we were to look at it from our point of view, he stopped praying, stopped reading the word, stopped going to church and mixing up with the believers. He took off the whole armor of God, threw down his sword, stopped fighting sin, I don&#8217;t care spirit came in, started wondering why he came to Christ in the first place and some. The enemy came in and planted doubt, fear, hatred, confusion, lack of patience and many things. We are told to keep our hearts with all diligence meaning guard our heart at all times for that is where the issues of life flow from. We are told to protect the seed at all cost, fight for the seed, so as not to allow the enemy to plant weeds in our lives. Have you been guarding the seed like you should or are you sleeping on the job, the reason the enemy is planting weeds in your life. <\/p>\n<p>I have slept on the job a couple of times and boy the enemy planted the wrong things, the moment I began to guard the precious seed, watered it, natured it, cherished it and fought for it, the enemy had a tough time trying to place a foot into my heart. The moment I went to sleep, he was running the show. He bound me again in grave clothes and I had no strength to fight back and I became a victim. The sleep does not just happen, it starts with something small like sitting down and then progresses to something new and before you know it, you are way gone. It&#8217;s very hard to tell when you went to sleep but good thing is that we can wake up from the sleep. Hebrews 12:1, &#8220;The night is far spent and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast aside the works of darkness and let us put on the armor or light&#8221;. No more sleeping on the job. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning friends Mathew 13:24-30, &#8220;&#8230;The Kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seeds in his field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way&#8221; The bible lets us know about how the Kingdom of God is likened to, and we are [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-514","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-8i","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/514","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=514"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/514\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=514"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=514"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=514"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":513,"date":"2006-05-11T06:47:14","date_gmt":"2006-05-11T06:47:14","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/05\/11\/and-the-brook-dried-up-part-2\/"},"modified":"2006-05-11T06:47:14","modified_gmt":"2006-05-11T06:47:14","slug":"and-the-brook-dried-up-part-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/05\/11\/and-the-brook-dried-up-part-2\/","title":{"rendered":"And The Brook Dried Up, Part&nbsp;2"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,<\/p>\n<p>Vs 6, &quot;The ravens brought him bread in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook, vs. 7, &quot;And it happened after awhile that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land&quot;. There are certain jobs, positions, ministries that God allowed us to be in for a while for He fed us, ministered to us, provided for us and the like and we knew for sure that it was God&#39;s will to be in that place, but we need to understand that there are times when the brook dries up meaning that which you thought would always be there is gone, the zeal you had for that position dried up, the patience you had for that thing dries up. At this time it&#39;s very easy to say it may have not been God&#39;s will for me to be there but the truth of the matter is, it was God&#39;s will for you to be there but for just for a season. When you are beginning to get comfortable, He will relocate you so as to depend on God even more, change causes us to see God in different dimensions and change also allows us not to limit God in any way. If God provided away for me to be at this brook, I believe that He has already provided another way for He is the way maker.<\/p>\n<p>Guys, the brook can dry up, your spiritual brook can dry up, zeal to serve others can dry up, finances can dry up, and jobs and positions can also dry up for we the believers are nomadic people always on the move climbing from glory to glory. Don&#39;t expect to find some of us in the previous brooks for when they dried up, it was time to trust God for the next move.. Don&#39;t be trying to revive a brook that dried up for what God has closed can no man open and what God has opened can no man close. Ask the Lord what direction to take, He has a lot of ways of blessing His people.<\/p>\n<p>My question to God is, why allow a brook to dry up while the three year period of no rain is still on? read from vs. 8 and you will see that God was providing another way and this time Elijah is to meet a widow who will provide for him. I bet Elijah went happy for God had provided a way but God did not tell him that the widow had only little oil and little flour to which she was just going to make the last bread for her and her son and thereafter die. Greater levels, greater service to others, greater miracles to be expected and so are greater challenges. At the brook he wasn&#39;t serving and yet he had enough, at the widow&#39;s, he is expected to serve while there is less than enough but the good news is that he is sent to rescue someone else. Thank God that when He relocates you, He has someone or some people in mind He desires you to reach. As He blesses them, He will bless you too. The bible says that &quot;don&#39;t be weary in well doing for in time you will reap if you don&#39;t faint&quot;. At first it was about his needs, now it&#39;s about other people&#39;s needs and his. Lord when the brook has dried up, send me to another place for there is still much to be done.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Vs 6, &quot;The ravens brought him bread in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening; and he drank from the brook, vs. 7, &quot;And it happened after awhile that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land&quot;.

And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice. And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.&quot; 1 Sam. 18:10-12 It has been said &quot;the pen is mightier than the sword.&quot; However, few may know that Edward George Bulwer Lytton (1803-1873), an English novelist, wrote this for the first time in 1839. He wrote, &quot;Beneath the rule of men entirely great, the pen is mightier than the sword.&quot; <a href=\"http:\/\/humanities.byu.edu\/elc\/student\/idioms\/proverbs\/the_pen.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/humanities.byu.edu\/elc\/student\/idioms\/proverbs\/the_pen.html<\/a>. In the natural this doesn&#39;t make sense, but there are great spiritual truths to be learned in principal.  In the days of David, King Saul&#39;s jealousy toward David grew to a place of attempted murder.In the heat of battle I would much rather have a javelin than a harp. What can I do with a harp in battle?  Perhaps with my musical ability I could play the harp in such a manner that my lack of talent would cause the enemy to cover their ears and retreat.  A harp was a grounded instrument, a stable instrument, while a javelin in a weapon that one can carry around.  This reminds me of that character of Saul and David.  David was grounded in God, as the presence of God rested upon him. Saul was flighty and unstable; one never knew when Saul would &quot;loose it&quot; and snap.  Saul lived by his emotions and his title as king. David lived by his godly character and His anointing to soon become the king.  David was patient and obedient, while Saul was hurried and disobedient.<\/p>\n<p>Now David had a harp in his hand while Saul had a javelin in his.  With the harp David pleased God, drove evil spirits away from Saul and thus served the king.  With the javelin Saul purposed to pin David to death upon the wall.  David was growing in popularity as the people said, &quot;Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.&quot; Although Saul had the title as king, he feared David greatly because the Lord was with David and had departed from Saul.  The Apostle Paul penned the words, &quot;&#8230;If God is for us, who can be against us?&quot; God was for David because David was righteous.  He had a right standing before God.  As a spiritual boxing match, God was in David&#39;s corner, just as He was when David killed Goliath.  David&#39;s behaved very wisely and Saul behaved very fearfully.  I imagine that Saul was quit skilled with the Javelin, but when he threw it at David, David dodged the weapon.  Although Saul tried to kill David, David NEVER tried to retaliate in any way against Saul.  In this day and age many pride themselves on subverting authority when one feels they are in the right.  David had the Spirit of God, and therefore was defending by God.  David teaches us many things.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use what God gives you, even if it a simple harp.<\/li>\n<li>Be stable in God<\/li>\n<li>Behave in wisdom not in fear.

We know this for sure for the word of God says that in Isaiah 55:8&amp;9, &quot;for my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my way, for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways&quot; says the Lord. When you think that everything is out of control, He is in control for nothing escapes Him. Eccle 3:11, &quot;He has made everything beautiful in His time&quot;. We need to understand that it&#39;s His time that counts and not my time.<\/p>\n<p>Elijah the prophet in 1Kings 17 has just prophesied to king Ahab that there would be no rain in Israel for a period of three years. If you look at chapter 16 of 1Kings vs. 33, &quot;And Ahab made a wooden image. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him&quot;. Ahab was bad news, he had married a wicked woman by the name of Jezebel who turned his heart away from God. Anytime God is getting ready to do something in a land, He will always provide a way for escape for His children. Though the wickedness of Ahab provoked God to shut the heavens from providing rain, everyone in the land of Israel had to be affected by that circumstance regardless of whether they were righteous or not. It&#39;s true even today people do things that cause others to suffer and yet they are innocent.<\/p>\n<p>I thank God that there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, (Romans 8:1) for in times of trouble God will hide us under His pavilion in the secret of His tabernacle shall He hide me (Psalm 91) for in the absence of everything that I need daily, He will provide according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus, (Phil 4:19). Elijah has just prophesied and the prophesy also affects him for he lives in Israel but He is faithful to take God at His word. 1Kings 17:2&amp;3, &quot;Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, &quot;Get away from here and turn eastward, and hide by the Brook Cherith, which flows into the Jordan. And it will be that you shall drink from the brooks, and I have commanded thee ravens to feed you there&quot;. Praise God for His plans and provisions, in as much as there is drought in the land, God has preserved a brook for His chosen man, and on the other hand, He has commanded the ravens to feed him with bread and meat. I would pause here for a sec. I understand something about the brook for it must have been flowing from the river Jordan, but how do you explain the bread, where was the bread and meat coming from? who was baking the bread? and how come the raven could not eat the bread? and to make it even interesting, the raven knew who Elijah was. We will never fully grasp how God works but we sure love when He does the impossible. He is the God who takes less and does much with it. He is the God who does things that leaves you wondering how he did it and it&#39;s for us also to understand that our ways are not His ways. How we see things are not how He sees them. When you least expect Him to move that is the time He will move. When you think that there is nothing around He can use, that is the time He will surprise you by taking that little thing and making something great out of it.

One lady  had filed for a divorce because her husband was not supporting the family. She accused him of going places and not being there for her and her children when in the actual sense, he was busy working hard to provide and care for his family. This lady was divorcing him primarily because he wasn&#39;t providing. While still talking about what the husband wasn&#39;t doing, it was discovered that after she kicked her husband out of the house, she began to date and live with another guy who had no income, actually she was providing for him. All he did was sit, watch TV all day while she worked hard to provide for her family and him. Sounds interesting and scary but things happen out there.<\/p>\n<p>What would you do when what you always dreamed for wasn&#39;t coming to pass?, instead of things getting better and better to lead you towards that dream, you got  further and further away from it. Joseph is a good example, he had a dream at the age of 17 and his dream was not that one day he will fail but that one day he will be great and that his family and many people would bow to him. Talk to any teenagers today and hear all their dreams and desires of success. You must have had dreams at that age too. Joseph has a good dream but he is naive, boastful and insensitive towards his brothers. There is a lot of character to build before he comes to his dream that he does not even have an idea it will come to pass.<\/p>\n<p>Genesis 39:1, &quot;Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. And Potiphar, an office of Pharaoh&#8230; brought him from Ishmaelites who had taken him down there&quot;. He is brought to Egypt as a slave, bowing to someone else. What happened to the dream to which people were bowing to him? It&#39;s not surprising that some people become careless when things are not going as they planned and expected, they begin to misuse what they have, they treat position they have casually, doing a poor job because that is not where they wanted to land, sitting down being lazy but what did Joseph do?, he wasn&#39;t where he desired to be but yet he was still faithful, hard working, honest, efficient, effective, responsible and initiative in all he did. vs. 2, &quot;The Lord was with Joseph, and he was successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian&quot;. I would expect that if the Lord was with him, that could have opened a door for complaints, murmuring, bitterness and anger towards the Lord. He would have done all yet he saw this as an opportunity to enlarge his character, Philippians 2:14, &quot;Do all things without complaining and disputing&quot;. It&#39;s like Joseph saying, &quot;I am not where I desired to be and I don&#39;t know whether I will get there but now I have responsibility under my master and I will do it faithfully, do well and make my master proud&quot;. I don&#39;t believe the Lord told him what to do, he just saw an opportunity to serve and the Lord blessed him for being initiative. Later he was made overseer of the entire house of Potiphar, things are getting better, he is good at what he is doing and the Lord is really blessing the house and then he looses his position because  Potiphar&#39;s wife who wanted him to sleep with her. Once beaten and thrown in prison, someone would think he would stop being the man of character but even in prison, he served, he was initiative and responsible. This allowed him to have favor with the keeper of prison and once again he was made in charge.<\/p>\n<p>Joseph allowed people to see the Lord inside of him through working hard, being responsible and being a man who was initiative. Whatever he did, the Lord made it prosper and so is with us today. You may not be where you want to be in career, relationship, job wise, position but you can still be all you can for God even where you are. Don&#39;t sit and wait for the Lord to bring you to your destiny when He has allowed you to be in a place that will tailor you to your destiny. Initiative is doing good things without being told, do the best you can with all you have and the Lord will bless and prosper you in all you do.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<\/p>\n<p>Evans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 39:1-23, &quot;And his master saw that the Lord was with him and that Lord made all he did to prosper in his hand.&quot; One time I was watching TV when one of the divorce courts shows came on.

And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.&quot; (Acts 8:29-30; 38-39)During war time in the military when a platoon is trying to find the enemy and the military leader suddenly places his hand in the air and closes his fight, all his immediately stop.  Why because their eyes are on their leader, and one more step could be a land mind and blow off their leg, or end their very life.  Even towns and cities know the value of stopping which is why they have placed stop signs and stop lights to better control traffic.<\/p>\n<p>There are times when God wants us to stop and not take another step forward.  Perhaps one is reading God&#39;s word and a certain truth seems to bring off the page into your spirit and it stops you in your tracks.  If you&#39;re like most, you stop for a moment because it&#39;s like a stop light, and then you envision a green light and you go.  However, when God stops you as you are reading His word, it is because there is a truth, a warning, an encouragement, a piece of wisdom, etc&#8230; that He has for you now.  In our church one member was reading the Scriptures and the words from Genesis, &quot;Who told you that,&quot; seemed to leap off the page at them.  This in turn caused her to weigh the words others said to them, or perhaps even their own thoughts that came into their mind.  Have you said to yourself, &quot;I&#39;m a failure,&quot; or were you ever told hurtful words such as &quot;you&#39;ll never amount to anything.&quot;  Who told you that!  Did God say that to you?  When we are stopped in our tracks as we read God&#39;s word, there is a reason and God knows that reason, and failure to stop at that verse, passage, question, word, command will result in a consequence.  A soldier failing to stop could be killed, a car failing to stop at a light may crash, a Christian failing to stop will feel the effect and it could be disastrous.  Just as the military leader signals stop because he senses grave danger ahead, how much more should we as Christians stop, because when God says &quot;STOP,&quot; He sees what is ahead for us, and failing to stop when He says stop will not turn out in our favor.<\/p>\n<p>The Spirit told Philip to go and STOP at the chariot, but never gave the reason to Philip.  Philip ran and STOPPED hearing the eunuch reading the Scriptures, and Phillip shared Jesus with him.  Imagine if Philip didn&#39;t STOP.  Who would have explained the passage of Scripture to the eunuch?  Then the newly converted eunuch gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.  However when they came up out of the water the Holy Spirit had translated Philip 30 miles away to another town.  This may be difficult to fathom, but if Jesus can be taken from death to life, then Philip can be taken from town to town.  Imagine if they had never stopped for the baptism and at specific time the Holy Spirit was going to take Philip away, then who would have baptized the eunuch.<\/p>\n<p>When God tells you to STOP it is for your own good, so that you can GO right!  Is there a verse, passage of Scripture, habit, ect&#8230;, that God has said STOP?  What are you moving for?  Today is the day to STOP in your tracks, because the next step may be something that you can&#39;t handle without receiving what you need when you are stopped.  Even a car stops for gas, can&#39;t God&#39;s people stop from Him!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&quot;The Spirit told Philip, &quot;Go to that chariot and stay near it.&quot; Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. &quot;Do you understand what you are reading?&quot; Philip asked.

So they all ate and were filled. And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fish.&quot;  (Mark 6:40 &#8211; 43)<\/p>\n<p>Sowing and reaping is a farming principal that certainly melds over into a variety of life situations outside farming.  The farming practice is that if you sow your seed at the right time, in due season (harvest time) you will reap plentiful crops.  The Scriptures show us that times when this principle certainly has been misrepresented in life practice.  Recall in Matt. 25 the man that buried his talent and upon his return the master found that the servant had not sown it so that it would grow, and therefore no profit was reaped.  He was called a wicked lazy servant and cast out, never to be entrusted with the masters goods.  The prodigal son sowed his wild oats and, at some point I imagine, prayed for &quot;crop failure.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>The disciples wanted to send the people away to the country and the villages to go buy themselves bread, for they had nothing to eat. Jesus turned to his disciples and said you feed them.  The disciples were most likely discouraged as they thought of the impossible amount of money it would take to feed a crowd like this one. The Expositors Bible Commentary tells us &quot;Two hundred denarii represented the pay a common laborer earned in a period of about eight months (cf. Matt 20:2-15, where the usual pay for a day&#39;s wage is one denarius). Not even that amount of money would buy enough bread for all to eat (cf. John 6:7: &quot;for each one to have a bite&quot;).  Knowing this, makes their feelings make a lot of sense.  Then he asked them how much food they had with them, and they replied five loaves of bread and two fish. Perhaps again they were thinking, &quot;Jesus if you take the little bit of food we have and give it to these people you will have done two stupid things, one there is not enough to feed these people, and two we won&#39;t have any food to eat then.  However, Jesus had his men instruct the crowd to sit down in ranks of hundreds and by fifties.  Jesus was beginning to show his men how he would use their lives, help, and resources to be a blessing to others.  Jesus took the food they had, blessed it, broke it, and gave them to his disciples.<\/p>\n<p>The result was two fold.  First, &quot;they did all eat AND WERE FILLED&#8230; and they that did eat&#8230;were about five thousand men [not counting women and children].&quot;  Second, &quot;and they [the disciples] took up TWELVE baskets full of fragments, and of fishes.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>When we sow our resources into the Kingdom of God, hence give the Lord what is really rightfully His everything we are caretakers of, he can bless it, break it and feed multitudes with it.  He can do miracles with what you sow into the Kingdom.  The disciples, although not knowing the outcome, and perhaps being nervous about their own hunger being in jeopardy, obeyed Christ and were blessed.  Their sowing of food, resulted in everyone being feed to their hearts content, and there were TWELVE baskets left over.  Were there not twelve disciples? You see when you sow into His Kingdom with the little you have, He will provide for your needs.<\/p>\n<p>Application:  God is asking for you to invest (sow) your time, talents, and treasures into His kingdom.

And he said:, &quot;I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard  me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice&quot;. Amen, out of  the belly of the fish cried I to the Lord. Out of the mess I got myself into  cried I unto the Lord and He heard me and answered me. God had every right to  reject Jonah&#39;s prayers but His love is an everlasting love and if we call on  Him, He will answer us. Being in the belly of the fish reminded him that God was  always there with him and that is why he could call. That was a place of  humility where he would say, &quot;Lord is not about me but about you&quot;, WHEN YOU CALL  ME, I WILL ANSWER; WHEN YOU LEAD ME I WILL FOLLOW; WHEN YOU SEND ME I WILL GO;  WHEN YOU NEED ME, I WILL BE AVAILABLE AND WHEN YOU FIND ME, I WILL BE DOING  SOMETHING FOR YOU. Read it for yourself and you will see how he was vomited and  he takes the assignment with dignity and humility.<\/p>\n<p>So lets find out why Jonah decided to run from the presence of God. Being  that Nineveh was a wicked city, God had passed a judgment that the city would be  destroyed in 40 days. Jonah&#39;s mission was to come and preach this message in  this city. The reason why he did not want to go to the city was not because he  feared how the message was terrible or whether people would kill him because of  that but because he knew that the moment he preached the message, many were  going to repent and be saved and God would show mercy unto them even though He  promised to destroy the city. This was his problem and that is God giving grace  to a perverted city but after realizing that he also needed grace, mercy and  pardon when he messed up, the people of Nineveh also needed such a chance to  have grace, mercy and pardon when they also messed upon and turned away from  God.<\/p>\n<p>Do we have to hit rock bottom to cry out to God? Do we call on Him when  things are bearable? do we desire to see some of our friends and family members  come to a place of grace, mercy and pardon just as we did receive it, or would  we care less as long as we are okay. WHEN HE CALLS ME, I WILL ANSWER TO THAT  CALL.<\/p>\n<p>If I had more time, I would dig through this book even more but let&#39;s  conclude it this morning by knowing that God is love, full of mercy and  compassion, His presence is everywhere, He cares about sinners and that is the  reason He is calling His people that He may send them and that He is a God of  second chances.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Chapter 2:1, &quot;Then Jonah prayed to the Lord His God from the fish&#39;s belly.

And  Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights&quot;. I have met  people who blame God for what they brought upon themselves. People who did  terrible things that landed them even in jail and yet they stand out there and  say, &quot;why did God do this to me or why did God allow this to happen to me?&quot;.  It&#39;s the choice made by an individual that will cause them to either suffer or  be safe. In this case, though Jonah brings all the calamities upon himself and  deserves to die, in the midst of his foolishness God is still gracious to him.  Now you might say how was God gracious to him if He had prepared a great fish to  swallow him? Someone else would also say to me that how was God gracious when he  allowed me to go to prison or be down and broken, well let me tell you,  something worse than where you were could have happened but His hand of mercy  kept us from the worst things that could have happened. It&#39;s not that they could  not happen, He kept them from happening. I am not better than those who have  already gone to an early grave, the worst could have happened to me too but he  preserved me even in the mess I was in. Jonah could have drowned without  repenting and we don&#39;t know what could have happened to him in eternity. Being  that he was in the sea, he could had been torn into pieces by the sea creatures  but God preserved his life by allowing a great fish to swallow him that  eventually he will have a chance to repent.<\/p>\n<p>Jonah is acting what Jesus would do many years after his incident. Even in  his foolishness and not knowing what he was doing, he was acting what Jesus  would do. Jonah being in the belly of the fish three days and three nights shows  what Jesus did when He died on the cross and was buried. He was in the tomb  three days and on that third day He rose again and became a winner over death.  While we are still on the subject of being swallowed by fish, Jonah is covered  by a lot of yucky stuff, he is in a place of no freedom, nothing to eat, dark  place, can&#39;t move and he is not a ware of where he is apart from knowing he is  swallowed. I think this is the time when people appreciate what they had before  they landed in the worst places and I bet a lot of things were going on in the  mind of Jonah about how he landed in all this, he had a chance to repent but he  blew it, he almost drowned but God was still there to show him love and mercy.  He began to evaluate his life and how he had made it this far by the grace of  God. God still loves His people and will always fight for them even when they  fail because HIS LOVE IS NOT BASED ON WHAT WE DID BUT WHAT HE&#39;S SON DID ON THE  CROSS. Romans 5:8, &quot;But God demonstrates His love towards us, in that while we  were yet sinners, Christ died for us&quot;.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning friends, Jonah 1-4, &quot;And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice&quot; Chapter 1:17, &quot;Now the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah.

(Galatians 1:8)<\/p>\n<p>It is believed by some that there are about 20 &#8211; 30 gospels that have been written. When Christians think about the gospel what comes to mind? Perhaps some words like four, good news, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, etc&#8230;. However there are writings that some non-gospel writings that some claim have been cleverly left out of the Bible because of contradictions with the four books of the gospel. The Gospel of Thomas, Judas, and Mary are three to name a few. Unfortunately many Christians don&#39;t know there Bible that well and are unfamiliar with church history. A few years back the famous book fad that came out was called the Bible Code. Now the Da Vinci Code and the Gospel of Judas are the latest fads.<\/p>\n<p>Jesus said, &quot;At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.&quot; Jesus said, &quot;THIS GOSPEL of THE KINGDOM WILL BE PREACHED&#8230;&quot; The Law of God condemns all humanity and breaks the hard heart, but it is the gospel that heals the broken hearted. These other writings are not the gospel. The Gospel of Judas doesn&#39;t even mention God&#39;s Law which Jesus referred to all throughout His earthly ministry.

Paul said that if a man or even an angel from heaven preaches another gospel let him be accursed! Bankers can spot counterfeit currency because they spend so much time looking at the real thing. Let&#39;s commit ourselves to looking into the real thing, and living that real thing, the gospel. We are called to know, do, and preach His Gospel. Do you have a love for what Jesus said? The very author of life has left us a life manual called the gospel. God has trusted His children with the gospel, to magnify it among the nations. Jesus said, &quot;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news (gospel) to the poor [in spirit].&quot; If the Spirit of the Lord is upon you, then you too are called to be one that proclaims this gospel. Since, the world is interested in these gospel fads of Satan, why not use them as a springboard to bring the gospel to them.

Many knew that any time something was not happening right, most likely someone had sinned and the only way they could deal with it was to zero out the victim and deal with that sin so as to have peace again. The situation would not change until the issue was dealt with. It&#39;s even with us today, many of our prayers will not be answered even though they may be genuine until sin is dealt with in our lives. We cannot shout on top of sin, we got to deal with it. 1John 1:8, &quot;If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us&quot;, meaning that if we say we have no sin, we are calling Him a liar. Sin for sure will hinder us from getting where the Lord wants us to be. Our friend Jonah begins to explain how he ran from the presence of the Lord after refusing to take the assignment he had been given. The men in the ship are afraid because they are suffering for the sake of someone&#39;s sin.<\/p>\n<p>Chapter 1:12, &quot;And he said unto them, take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you&quot;. Surprisingly enough, he has shared with the men in the ship about what he has done, he is in a position to repent and allow God to forgive him but instead, he wants people to drown him. The bible says the Lord is good and gracious, slow to anger, He rescues them that call upon His name. 1John 1:9, &quot;But if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us of all our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness&quot;. Well we could say that Jonah is tough headed but while we are at it, how many times have I messed up and when I had a chance to repent and be cleansed again I ignored and kept on trying to run away from Him? We have been talking about trying to run away from His presence but let&#39;s use something in the natural to strengthen that, when I was 2 years old, that is about 18 years ago, when the sun came up, I could see my shadow just before me or behind me. Many times I tried to run away from my shadow but could never escape from it for it was always with me. When we came to Christ, His light was shone upon us and we saw Him as He is and we can never escape His presence. You might say that I haven&#39;t seen the light yet, well His presence is always with you, the light gives the proof that He never leaves us.<\/p>\n<p>Chapter 1:13, &quot;Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land: but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them&quot;. Instead of the men even encouraging Jonah to repent and be saved, they tried their human effort to bring the ship to the land safely by fighting the waves. Pause for a second, God is in control here and men want to be their own god, lead themselves to safety without His help, trying hard to do what only God can do? I&#39;m not surprised, we always do the same trying to do it in another way when we know the right way to do it. Trying to escape from the responsibility we got to deal with. So they failed to beat God in His game and Jonah is thrown into the sea. I ask myself a question here, was he willing to die just because of his disobedience? Are we willing to suffer more because we have refused to repent?<\/p>\n<p>We know that it&#39;s not by might nor by power but by His Spirit says the Lord Zech 4:6, it&#39;s a simple as that, in as much as we might try and fix it ourselves like the men in the ship, it will not work out for we are trying to fix the spiritual stuff through the flesh.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Jonah 1-4, &quot;And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice&quot; When Jonah was woken out of his sleep, all the men decided to cast lots to see who was the reason for [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-504","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-88","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/504","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=504"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/504\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=504"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=504"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=504"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":502,"date":"2006-04-26T09:24:45","date_gmt":"2006-04-26T09:24:45","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/04\/26\/giving-back-to-the-lord-by-pastor-phil\/"},"modified":"2006-04-26T09:24:45","modified_gmt":"2006-04-26T09:24:45","slug":"giving-back-to-the-lord-by-pastor-phil","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/04\/26\/giving-back-to-the-lord-by-pastor-phil\/","title":{"rendered":"Giving Back to the Lord, by Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>1Sa 1:10 &quot;In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD. 1Sa 1:11 And she made a vow, saying, &quot;O LORD Almighty , if you will only look upon your servant&#39;s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.&quot; (1 Samuel 1:10 &#8211; 11)<\/p>\n<p>Our society is one that thrives on ownership. There are copyright laws on movies, songs, books, and deeds for houses, and titles for cars, etc&#8230; all showing owner of things. However when one has a child to whom does that child belong? The Psalmist wrote, Ps 127:3 Sons are a heritage from the LORD, children a reward from Him.&quot; In the book of Samuel we are met by a woman that was in bitterness of soul because she was barren. In those days to be barren was considered to be cursed by God. Hannah would weep and fast from food because she so wanted a son so bad and her heart was in deep anguish.<\/p>\n<p>Hannah vows a vow and tells the Lord that if He will grant her a son, she will give him back to the Lord all the days of his life. Wow, if the Lord gives her what she yearns for she will give her son away to the Lord. God takes our vows very seriously as Solomon points out in Ecclesiastes 5:4, &quot;When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. 5 It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.&quot; Hannah makes her vow in prayer to the Lord, and Eli the priest confirms the answer from the Lord, that indeed God has heard her prayer, and she will have a son. This word from the Lord lifted her spirit and she was sad no longer. God&#39;s Word met her right where she was, He met sadness with joy, hopelessness with hope, and barrenness with a child. Her son is born, which would become the prophet Samuel which would later anoint King David to the throne of Israel. Hannah&#39;s prayer was desperate, selfless, and committed.<\/p>\n<p>1. Desperate prayer. Hannah was in a time of desperation. Much more can be said of women in those days bearing children, but this was her hearts desire and she brought it to God. Where do you bring your deepest hearts desires, your dreams, your vision? Do you bring them to the Lord, or elsewhere?<\/p>\n<p>2. Selfless prayer. Hannah&#39;s prayer was answered, and &quot;unto her a child was given.&quot; However she promised God that she would give Him to the Lord all the days of Samuels life. The very child she was desperate for, she was willing to give back to her Lord as a gift back to Him. Are you selfish in your prayers, or selfless? Jesus prayed, &quot;not my will be your be done.&quot; Before we can pray &quot;Thy Kingdom come [thy will be done],&quot; we must be willing to pray &quot;my kingdom go [my will be gone] ALAN REDPATH.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>3. Committed prayer. Hannah did not delay on fulfilling her vow to the Lord. Hannah brought Samuel to Eli the prophet and he was offered up to the Lord saying, &quot;Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. 27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: 28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD.&quot; When God answers your prayer in a vow do your keep your end of the vow?<\/p>\n<p>Are you desperate for the Lord? Is your prayer selfless and are you committed to serve Him with that which He gives you, whether things or people. Give to the Lord that which He has given you.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1Sa 1:10 &quot;In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD. 1Sa 1:11 And she made a vow, saying, &quot;O LORD Almighty , if you will only look upon your servant&#39;s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-502","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-86","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/502","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=502"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/502\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=502"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=502"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=502"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":501,"date":"2006-04-25T13:15:31","date_gmt":"2006-04-25T13:15:31","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/04\/25\/when-he-calls-me-part-2\/"},"modified":"2006-04-25T13:15:31","modified_gmt":"2006-04-25T13:15:31","slug":"when-he-calls-me-part-2","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/04\/25\/when-he-calls-me-part-2\/","title":{"rendered":"When He Calls Me, Part&nbsp;2"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Jonah 1-4, &quot;And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday we looked at the first verse of the first chapter of the book of Jonah. We looked at three important keys Word, Arise and Go. Like I mentioned yesterday, there are times where God will give us a certain assignment to accomplish and if you know about assignments, they are at times short term or long term but the key word to accomplishing the assignment is being faithful till the end.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#39;s look at what Jonah does when he receives the assignment. Vs. 3, &quot;But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord&#8230;&quot; Jonah should know very well that you can never run a way from the presence of the Lord for the Lord is ever present everywhere. Psalm 139 talks about how God knows us from the beginning to the end, He knows when we sit and when we stand, He is familiar with our ways. David continues to say, &quot;Lord if I put my bed in heaven, there you are, and if I put my bed in hell, there you are and if I took the wings of the morning and ascended to the uttermost parts of the earth, You will still be there&quot;. Right now there are many who are trying to run away from God. They know they are being convicted of things and instead of obeying the Lord, they have decided to run away from the presence of the Lord like Jonah. May I remind us this morning that what God has designed for us to do, no one else will come and do it on our behalf. We can run all we want but eventually we will have to answer to that call. John 15:16, &quot;You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain&quot; We did not choose Him, He chose us for a reason and for a purpose. You might say, &quot;well it&#39;s me who decided to follow Christ, I walked to the altar, I said the sinners prayer and I got saved&quot;. The truth of the matter is, when you gave your life to Christ, He chose you, put the right words in your heart, convicted you and caused you to see that the things which you always thought were foolish were actually good news. The bible says, &quot;a man cannot come to the Lord unless the Spirit draws him&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Jonah boarded a ship to go the opposite direction for he has his own good reasons for not responding to the call. Well everything seams to be going on well as planned by him but God will not let you do the opposite when He has a plan to save and deliver yourself and many. God wasn&#39;t going to allow Jonah to abandon the assignment and let a whole city go to hell simply because he did not want to do it. So what does the Lord do, even in the midst of Jonah&#39;s foolishness, He is still demonstrating His power, number one to get Jonah know who the Boss is and number two to turn the hearts of some men who were worshiping idols. vs. 4&amp;5, &quot;But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be brake. Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the luggage that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it for them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay and was fast a sleep&quot;. Our disobedience can make many suffer. We may be comfortable somewhere but someone somewhere will be hurting simply because of what we did or did not do. Remember in the OT, if one man sinned, the whole family suffered. Thank God, even the midst of our foolishness, God remains faithful. Watch something here, the men in the ship prayed to their gods, and their gods could not save them, they tried the human effort of getting rid of some stuff in their ship, but still that did not work out and let&#39;s look at vs. 6, &quot;so the shipmaster came to him (Jonah), and said unto him, what do you mean, O sleeper? Arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not&quot;. Amazing right, we see men who never called on the true God, they meet a man of God for the anointing of God was upon him and I bet that is how they could tell that he worshiped the true God and they say to him, &quot;call upon thy God&quot;. Romans 10:13, &quot;Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved, Psalm 18:3, &quot;I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies&quot;.<\/p>\n<p>I thank God that even in the midst of my foolishness He still shows Himself mighty through me that many may know Him. Jonah does not know that &quot;All things are working together for good to them that love God and to them that are called&quot;. It will cost him dearly for the disobedience but the work will still have to be done. Remember when David sinned by committing adultery with Bathsheeba, even in his failure, God had prepared something good out of it. Yes He suffered the consequences but out of that marriage, Solomon was born to become the wisest and a rich man. God does not want anyone to fall but if we do, He has already prepared something good out of our failure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jonah 1-4, &quot;And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice&quot; Yesterday we looked at the first verse of the first chapter of the book of Jonah.

We are not told of who Jonah was, his calling, how he grew up for this is not very important to the revelation of the text. We are also not told of how he aged and died but we are only told of his assignment, his reaction and his action. I believe that there are certain times in life where God will give us an assignment at times for a given period of time for He has desired to do something during the time of the assignment. Sometimes in 98, I was given an assignment to pray for schools. During that time there was so much going on in schools and Godlaid a burden in some hearts including mine to seriously pray for schools. I do still pray for schools but the intensity I had when the assignment was given was greater than now. What I am saying is that when God gives an assignment, He has already set up enough grace, strength and the ability for one to do it.<\/p>\n<p>Chapter 1:1, &quot;Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that city, great city and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me&quot;. We are introduced to some neat things in just verse one to which we will break it down as time goes by. The word of the Lord is present meaning a live everyday. It&#39;s always a now word for the Lord Himself is the Word. We hear Him introduce Himself as the &quot;I AM&quot; in the bible. Hebrews 4:12, &quot;The word of the Lord is living and powerful&#8230;&quot; we see it again as not a dead word or a word that will live but a word that is already living and this is the word that comes to Jonah. Number one point, the WORD coming, after the word comes, the first instruction in the word is ARISE. I would interpret as coming out of what someone has been in because of the word and making the first move by obeying the voice. Then GO which is to change locations by allowing a motion to take place.<\/p>\n<p>The three, WORD, ARISE and GO are very familiar to us in the bible for we see the Lord constantly using them when getting ready to do something. He is always in the business of speaking and in His speaking there are clear instructions as to what is to be done. We also have this kind of calling in our lives where the word comes, we arise and we go. The bible says , &quot;go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature&quot;. We don&#39;t hear about sit ye but go ye. I love the sit ye part but that is not the instructions. The words of the Lord are always action and doing words for He is constantly on the move, He is always doing something and we are part of these things He is doing. Ready for a move?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jonah 1-4, &quot;And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice&quot; When you begin to read this book, you will find that there is a specific task that God has for Jonah that He requires [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-499","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-83","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/499","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=499"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/499\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=499"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=499"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=499"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":500,"date":"2006-04-21T06:45:35","date_gmt":"2006-04-21T06:45:35","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/04\/21\/gods-decrease-your-increase-sifting-for-victory-part-2-by-pastor-phil\/"},"modified":"2006-04-21T06:45:35","modified_gmt":"2006-04-21T06:45:35","slug":"gods-decrease-your-increase-sifting-for-victory-part-2-by-pastor-phil","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/04\/21\/gods-decrease-your-increase-sifting-for-victory-part-2-by-pastor-phil\/","title":{"rendered":"God&#8217;s Decrease, Your Increase (Sifting for Victory) Part 2 &#8211; by Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>&quot;During that night the LORD said to Gideon, &quot;Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands. If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp.&quot; So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp. (Judges 7: 9 &#8211; 11)<\/p>\n<p>Gideon&#39;s army was less then 1 percent of its original size after the shifting took place, when God cut the majority of troops from the team through the leadership of Gideon. Gideon is resting at night, and God interrupts his rest with urgent orders to respond to divinely urgent news. Gideon is commanded to get up because God is going to give him the victory if he would attack immediately. Knowing Gideon&#39;s heart, God sees Gideon&#39;s fear, and responds to it with encouragement. Although faith is the opposite of fear at times we need to be navigated from one point to the other on the vehicle of encouragement. God told Gideon if you are too afraid to attack right now then spy on your enemies and eavesdrop on their conversation, you will be encouraged by what you hear. What could they possible hear from the enemy that would give them encouragement?<\/p>\n<p>In sports competition I would love it if the opposing team would begin to fight against themselves, or when they would somehow lose heart. A divided team can&#39;t stand, and a team that has no heart because it is gripped by fear has crippled themselves before engaging in the battle. At this point both armies were fearful of one another, but God was about to rip the fear from Gideon&#39;s heart and encourage him, thus replacing fear with faith. Gideon and Purah (most likely his armor-bearer) eavesdrop on the enemies camp and, &quot;Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. &quot;I had a dream,&quot; he was saying. &quot;A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed.&quot; His friend responded, &quot;This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands.&quot; No doubt this dream came from God to their enemies, as the fear of Gideon&#39;s sword ransacked their minds, gripping them with fear, discouragement, and defeat, before the battle was even engaged. I believe it was at this point that Gideon finally believed God. There are some great truth here for God&#39;s present day soldiers, you and me.<\/p>\n<p>1. God&#39;s Word is timely. We are bound by the realm of time, and God is not. God told Gideon to go now to either battle or eavesdrop and Gideon obeyed. Our enemies are defeated already, but we need to listen to God&#39;s Word to be reminded of that truth. Jesus said in John 8:31 &#8211; 32, &quot;If you&#8230;continue in my word&#8230;the truth will set you free.&quot; God&#39;s Word brings freedom if we apply it. Are you a hearer of God&#39;s Word or a doer of God&#39;s Word?<\/p>\n<p>2. God&#39;s Word is encouraging. We&#39;ve all been discouraged. Gideon&#39;s army was decreased yet the battle was still on the horizon. Both armies were gripped with fear, but God cares for his people, and meets our discouragement with encouragement, fighting fear with faith. Are you discouraged today, I&#39;ve been there many times, go to God&#39;s Word but you need not go alone.<\/p>\n<p>3. God&#39;s Word brings partnership. Gideon was commanded to go with Purah, his confidant, his close trustworthy partner. I can picture them smiling with huge grins at each other and being able to encourage one another. Now there were two people bringing encouragement back to the camp together. We need a close partner, who is yours? Do you encourage each other?<\/p>\n<p>Battles are here, more are coming, but God&#39;s Word is timely, encouraging, and brings partnership. God is victorious, let us act by faith upon his Word by being obedient to Him, regardless of the fear that grips our hearts.

In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own  strength has saved her,&quot; (Judges 7:2)<\/p>\n<p>When you are facing a difficult battle ahead does it make sense to decrease  your weapons? Gideon was the leader of Israel&#39;s army, and God would decrease the  size of Gideon&#39;s army with a battle just on the horizon. The Lord&#39;s instructions  probably came as a complete shock to Gideon. I can imagine the he was confused  upon hearing, &quot;You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands.&quot;  That doesn&#39;t sound very sensible to me; decrease your army size, because there  are too many men for battle. Gideon&#39;s army was already outnumbered four to one.  When I was trying out for sports teams growing up, if one didn&#39;t qualify for the  team they were cut from the team, so that only the best players were left to  produce a winning team. There were usually two cuts that took place. This is  what God did when he sifted Gideon&#39;s army. God cut the first wave of people from  the team by having Gideon announce, &quot;Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back  and leave Mount Gilead.&quot; The result was that &quot;twenty-two thousand men left,  while ten thousand remained.&quot; The first cut allowed the cowards to disqualify  themselves and go back home to mommy. Now God would have second cuts, and reduce  Gideon&#39;s army even further. A special examination or screening was set up based  on the manner of water drinking among the 10,000 remaining soldiers. There the  LORD told him, &quot;Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog  from those who kneel down to drink.&quot; (7:4) Three hundred men lapped with their  hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.&quot; Those  that kneeled down to drink were cut, and those that apparently crouched down to  scoop up water by using their hands as a dog uses its tongue remained. The LORD  said to Gideon, &quot;With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give  the Midianites into your hands.&quot; The size of the army went from 32,000 to 1,000  to a mere 300 men to fight. Why would God do such a thing?<\/p>\n<p>1. God can do a lot with a little. God can bring a victory with a few as  easily as he could with a large army. Israel would not be able to boast about  their victory, as the Lord removed all ground for boasting. Sometimes God  reduces you in order to prepare you to move forward, and increase you. John the  Baptist said, &quot;He must Increase, I must decrease (John 3:30).&quot; But this is not  all.<\/p>\n<p>2. God decreases us to show Himself strong. God said, &quot;&#8230;for my power is  made perfect in weakness.&quot; [Paul replied] Therefore I will boast all the more  gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ&#39;s power may rest on me.&quot; The world  needs to see God&#39;s power through your weakness. Are you shinning brightly, or  dimly?<\/p>\n<p>3. God Knows those that are willing to take risks for Him. Not everyone is  willing to obey God when things seem illogical on the surface. Sifting Gideon&#39;s  army for battle is not good military strategy in the natural, but in the  supernatural it was just what the Master ordered, and Gideon obeyed. What would  you have done?<\/p>\n<p>God can do a lot with very little to show Himself strong, and He knows those  that are willing to take risks for Him even when &quot;reason&quot; says otherwise. I,  you, we serve a victorious God. What is He asking you to do without to  accomplish His will? Are you willing to take that risk?<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&quot;The LORD said to Gideon, &quot;You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands.

When you are overwhelmed by the burdens, cares,  frustrations you have to go through, which place do you go to relieve your  burdens?. Who does not love vacation where you go a way, forget about the normal  routine of what you should do, how you should do it and what results to expect  at the end. You shut out stresses and concentrate on freedom to enjoy and gain  strength, relax and heal, and let someone else worry about it. A cartoon in a  newspaper presented this picture dialogue between a husband and wife. Both are  in bed sleeping but in the middle of the night, the husband wakes up, restless,  smoking and very worried. The loving wife inquires what&#39;s troubling him. Due to  lack of finances, he is in no position to pay next month&#39;s rent. Listen to his  wife&#39;s advise, &quot;WHY NOT CALL THE LANDLORD, TELL HIM YOU CAN&#39;T PAY NEXT MONTH&#39;S  RENT AND LET HIM BE THE ONE TO WORRY&quot;.<\/p>\n<p>You worry about what hasn&#39;t even happened yet, stressed out by a lot of  thinking, weary by trying so hard, frustrated by people and situations and your  cry is, &quot;I wish I could take a vacation&quot;. &quot;He who dwells in the secret place of  the Most High&quot;, what a way to begin the scripture, it does not start with  &quot;when&quot;. &quot;When&quot; talks about time, meaning things will begin to happen after  someone or something does take place, but &quot;HE WHO&quot; which is an action word,  shows that the provision is there and we should already be doing it. A vacation  to me is not when you go away but when you can rest and relax and let someone  else worry about what worries you. &quot;DWELLS&quot; is word that shows living, residing,  existing in a given place. This is where you have your address, everyone knows  that you live there, this is also where all your stuffs are. Everyday after hard  work, your destination is to your dwelling place. &quot;IN THE SECRET PLACE&quot;, I  wouldn&#39;t look at this as a place where I am trying to hide from everyone else  but a place I have discovered. People say, &quot;I have found the secret to my  success&quot;, of course we can tell that they have discovered something that they  did not know about. What you have discovered to improve your life is something  that you will cherish, you will look forward to being there. In our scripture,  the Psalmist has discovered a secret place he never knew of though it was always  there. &quot;MOST HIGH&quot;, allows us to understand that our secret place has no  limitations for the One who is in charge has everything in place. &quot;SHALL ABIDE  UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE ALMIGHTY&quot;, Most High reveals that you and I are small  and therefore we can abide (remain) under the shadow. I would imagine that  shadow here means a mirrored image or reflection.<\/p>\n<p>There is something about dwelling in the secret place that the Psalmist let&#39;s  us know why he loves it there. It&#39;s a place of refuge and fortress Psalm 91:2,  Proverbs 18:10, &quot;The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous run into  it, and they are safe&quot;, it&#39;s a place of safety, deliverance, covering, shielded  by faith, where darkness cannot comprehend, no destruction, where things fall  left and right and none of it comes near you. A place where the wicked cannot  make it but His angles are put in charge over you to keep you in all your ways.  A place where you cannot dash your foot on the rocks and serpents have no power  over you, why? Psalm 91:14, &quot;Because he has set his love upon Me (the Lord),  therefore I will deliver him&quot;. The more things the Lord does for him who dwells  in the secret, Vs 14, 15, 16, &quot;I will set him on high, because he has known my  name, he shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in  trouble; I will deliver him and honor him; With long life I will satisfy him,  and show my salvation&quot;.<\/p>\n<p>Those who know and love God will run to Him and dwell in His presence, they  will make His presence their residing place, a place they call home. After  dealing with everything, they will long to be in that place. Everything you ever  needed to help you get your sanity back is within. To crown it all, I&#39;m on  vacation in the midst of all that I have to do and doing them because I have a  secret place. CALL HIM AND LET HIM WORRY ABOUT IT CAUSE THERE IS SAFETY WITHIN  AND NOT WITHOUT!!!!!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Psalm 91:1, &quot;He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty&quot;.

When you talk about a garden, you think of a prepared place for new things to be planted in. Seeds usually come in mind when talking about garden. Anything planted in that garden has the power to spring forth if natured, watered and kept well. There are things that we tend to look after or work on that are actually weeds and because we have put so much energy trying to care for the newly growing plants, we have also taken good care of the weeds that eventually have chocked the good that was growing. I heard this line from another preacher; &quot;There is more power in the seed than in the sower&quot;. Any one can plant a good seed regardless of who they are but in as much as the sower might have skills if he has bad seeds, nothing will materialize.<\/p>\n<p>If I had time, I would look at Mat 13:24-30 and talk more on that but I will leave that for another day. People get overwhelmed by responsibilities they have to deal with every day. While you are still working on this, there comes another one, while trying to work on another one, here comes a new one. I tend to believe that everything has its season and how we deal with a situation during a certain season will determine the outcome of it. The overwhelming situations have chocked out peace, confidence and courage, as the weeds do know how to chock out good plants. I know that someone this morning is dealing with overwhelming situations not just at work but even at home, let&#39;s see what the Lord has for us this morning.<\/p>\n<p>Vs. 1 Hear my cry, O God, attend to my prayer, the first thing talked about in this line is prayer, have you prayed over your situation or did you wait for someone to come and lay hands on you for you to make it? Lay your own foundation and let someone else help you build the wall. I have met people that wanted to see things happen in their lives and the first question I would ask them, &quot;Have you laid your foundation?&quot;, you can help build the wall but foundation has to be laid by an individual. What is the foundation, faith. Vs. 2 From the ends of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed, Lead me to the rock that is higher than I, of course our hearts will get overwhelmed and so are our minds and bodies but what happens when they get overwhelmed? Please don&#39;t lead me to temptation, friends, neighbors, programs you name it, lead me to the Rock not just any rock, But the Rock that is higher than I. Why the rock, the rock cannot be overwhelmed, moved or shaken and if the rock is higher than I, I will make it my dwelling place as I can hide under it. Vs. 3 For you have been a shelter for me, A strong water from the enemy, I truly believe this as the bible says in Prov 18:10, &quot;The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous run into it and they are safe&quot;, just His name alone is a strong tower in other words a strong rock When you find yourself overwhelmed, calm your nerves, speak peace to yourself and be led to the rock that is higher than us. The bible says that in Nehemiah 8:10, &quot;&#8230;for the joy of the Lord is your strength.&quot; The unbelievers ask me why I always have this joy even when things at times don&#39;t go right or when I am overwhelmed, it&#39;s because I have learnt the secret and that is the joy of the Lord is my strength. Vs. 8, So I will praise Your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows, ouch, the writer concludes the chapter with this line as in the process of hiding under the rock, he will continue to praise and be glad and daily perform his vows. We have vowed to be the best we can be at our jobs by God&#39;s grace without complaining or murmuring for it is God which works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure, Phil 2:13. So keep on fighting the good fight of a soldier, enduring for He is your Rock of Ages, Strong Tower, Firm Foundation, Solid Rock, Anchor of you Life, need I say more?<\/p>\n<p>To sum up, we are all children in warriors gear. God is our armor therefore we make it but there are times when it gets too much that we have to cry.

When you talk about a garden, you think of a prepared place for new things to be planted in. Seeds usually come in mind when talking about garden. Anything planted in that garden has the power to spring forth if natured, watered and kept well. There are things that we tend to look after or work on that are actually weeds and because we have put so much energy trying to care for the newly growing plants, we have also taken good care of the weeds that eventually have chocked the good that was growing. I heard this line from another preacher; &quot;There is more power in the seed than in the sower&quot;. Any one can plant a good seed regardless of who they are but in as much as the sower might have skills if he has bad seeds, nothing will materialize.<\/p>\n<p>If I had time, I would look at Mat 13:24-30 and talk more on that but I will leave that for another day. People get overwhelmed by responsibilities they have to deal with every day. While you are still working on this, there comes another one, while trying to work on another one, here comes a new one. I tend to believe that everything has its season and how we deal with a situation during a certain season will determine the outcome of it. The overwhelming situations have chocked out peace, confidence and courage, as the weeds do know how to chock out good plants. I know that someone this morning is dealing with overwhelming situations not just at work but even at home, let&#39;s see what the Lord has for us this morning.<\/p>\n<p>Vs. 1 Hear my cry, O God, attend to my prayer, the first thing talked about in this line is prayer, have you prayed over your situation or did you wait for someone to come and lay hands on you for you to make it? Lay your own foundation and let someone else help you build the wall. I have met people that wanted to see things happen in their lives and the first question I would ask them, &quot;Have you laid your foundation?&quot;, you can help build the wall but foundation has to be laid by an individual. What is the foundation, faith. Vs. 2 From the ends of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed, Lead me to the rock that is higher than I, of course our hearts will get overwhelmed and so are our minds and bodies but what happens when they get overwhelmed? Please don&#39;t lead me to temptation, friends, neighbors, programs you name it, lead me to the Rock not just any rock, But the Rock that is higher than I. Why the rock, the rock cannot be overwhelmed, moved or shaken and if the rock is higher than I, I will make it my dwelling place as I can hide under it. Vs. 3 For you have been a shelter for me, A strong water from the enemy, I truly believe this as the bible says in Prov 18:10, &quot;The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous run into it and they are safe&quot;, just His name alone is a strong tower in other words a strong rock When you find yourself overwhelmed, calm your nerves, speak peace to yourself and be led to the rock that is higher than us. The bible says that in Nehemiah 8:10, &quot;&#8230;for the joy of the Lord is your strength.&quot; The unbelievers ask me why I always have this joy even when things at times don&#39;t go right or when I am overwhelmed, it&#39;s because I have learnt the secret and that is the joy of the Lord is my strength. Vs. 8, So I will praise Your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows, ouch, the writer concludes the chapter with this line as in the process of hiding under the rock, he will continue to praise and be glad and daily perform his vows. We have vowed to be the best we can be at our jobs by God&#39;s grace without complaining or murmuring for it is God which works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure, Phil 2:13. So keep on fighting the good fight of a soldier, enduring for He is your Rock of Ages, Strong Tower, Firm Foundation, Solid Rock, Anchor of you Life, need I say more?<\/p>\n<p>To sum up, we are all children in warriors gear. God is our armor therefore we make it but there are times when it gets too much that we have to cry. But when they all see how we survive and make it, they don&#39;t know that beneath that armor, the warrior is just a child. &quot;They don&#39;t know that I would go running home when I fall down, they don&#39;t know who picks me up when no one is around, sometimes I drop my sword and cry for a while, cause deep inside this armor, the warrior is just a child&quot;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Psalm 61:1-8, &quot;&#8230;From the end of the earth I will cry to You, when my heart is overwhelmed; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I&#8230;&quot; We have all been allowed to be some type of garden.

Come and see the place where he lay.&quot; Matthew 28:6<\/p>\n<p>Picture this, you are at a restaurant and the bill has just been handed to you. As you open your wallet or purse, you notice that it is empty. This would not be good. Empty hopes, empty promises, empty dreams, empty homes, and dare I say some seem to relate to those with empty minds. When one thinks of empty things, there is usually negativity attached to it. Emptiness usually speaks of something finished, over, void, etc&#8230;. The first time the term empty was used in the Scriptures it referred to the earth being &quot;formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.&quot; Emptiness was present, but so was the Spirit of God!<\/p>\n<p>Let&#39;s fast forward to the time of Jesus, where emptiness was the greatest word that could have filled the air. &quot;The angel said to the women, &quot;Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. 6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.&quot; Upon seeing where Jesus&#39; body had been placed by Joseph of Arimathea, they saw emptiness. The angel said it, but Jesus would confirm his words concerning the empty tomb. &quot;So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 9 Suddenly Jesus met them.&quot; Greetings,&quot; he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. 10 Then Jesus said to them, &quot;Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>This empty tomb is what all of Christianity hinges upon, an empty tomb! Paul said, &quot;If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith (1 Cor. 15:14).&quot; All of Christianity hinges on this one time, occurrence, namely the empty tomb, hence the resurrection. If Jesus didn&#39;t rise from the dead then all of Christianity is dead, and deserves to be buried in a tomb never to be thought of again! We should not believe because someone told us to, because we have to believe in something, or even out of tradition. We should believe or disbelieve based on truth. After all who wants to believe a lie? However if the empty tomb is still speaking today of the truth of Christ&#39;s resurrection, we should embrace it, and worship Him and the risen Lord and Savior, because he defeated death, hell, and the grave, paying the penalty for the law that we broke. Is the empty tomb the biggest hoax in history or the great truth of all time? It is one or the other, and all must decide which side they are on, because in reality ones life depends upon the empty tomb. If Jesus didn&#39;t rise then God is a liar and we are all still in our sins, and our preaching and faith is in vain. If the dead are not raised, &quot;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>The empty tomb speaks of fulfilled promises of prophecy, restored dreams, transcendent truth, peaceful patience, and future hope. Yes my whole life hinges on Christ&#39;s resurrection, I don&#39;t want to be religious, but rather right (a follower of absolute truth). Can you say with full assurance this resurrection Sunday that your faith is hinged upon emptiness, the truth of the empty tomb. If so then pass your faith on, for neither your faith nor your labor is in vain.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;Blessings, Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.

One thing that we have always been taught is that we have enemies we encounter with every single day of our lives at the same time we have been encouraged to fight some enemies and love some enemies. I have discovered that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them that are called according to His purpose, Rom 8:28, regardless of what that thing is, it still works for my good. Whether it was something bad planned against me, God would use it to make something good out of it. I believe that all enemies are not bad as some will cause you to pray again, trust in God, strengthen you. In the bible David sinned when he committed adultery with Bathsheeba, he suffered for his acts but God made something good out of his fall, Solomon a wise man, loved of God and very rich born out of that family. If that is not enough, when Samson messed us, he suffered for it but in the end God uses him in a mighty to destroy more enemies in his death than he did in his life. Over and over we see bad situations that God turns something good out of it. He always provides away for escape.<\/p>\n<p>John 19:34,&quot; But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water&quot;, Let&#39;s look at a man who just wants to finish a job started. Many had cried for Jesus to be crucified and finally they have the Son of God crucified between two thieves, He did not do anything to deserve the crucifixion like the two thieves but for our sake. He could have saved Himself but He chose to hang in there. After declaring that His work on earth was finished, He gave up the ghost. As they were about to lower His body for burial, one soldier pierced Him on His side to be sure He was dead. I thank God for the Roman soldier who had to do one last thing, pierce Him on the side. Everyone might condemn his act and so would I but I want us to look at the big picture. When he pierced Him on the side, out of His side came out water and blood for my sins, the bible calls Him the living water as that came out of His side that I might live and when the blood also came out of His side, it washed me from all of my sins.<\/p>\n<p>The greatest thing I want us to get out of this is why he pierced Him on the side. John 15:5,&quot;I am the vine and you are the branches, he that abides in me the same brings forth much fruit, for without me you can do nothing&quot;. The Roman soldier opened away for us to be grafted in, we were once attached to some wild trees that had bitter herbs, fruits and thorns, we were all growing in the cruel garden which is the world and when He died on the cross, we were cut off from those trees that we might be grafted on Him. If the grafting did not take place, my God I don&#39;t know where I would be today but when a way was opened, He allowed me to abide in Him as He is the vine and we are the branches. In the process of cutting and grafting, I lost some things but boy I gained more. The first fruit is holy and the roots are holy and when I got grafted in, I became like Him for now His blood is flowing through my veins, He is now feeding me and I can bare fruits because I am attached to Him. I don&#39;t have to worry about the outcome for He is in control, He&#39;s got everything in His hand all I have to do is abide and what I bare is a result of my attachment to Him. The process might take time as the branch will not just start baring fruit at once but it has to get used to being attached to the vine, flowing in the new fountain and adjusting it&#39;s life style and being conformed to the image of the Son of God. If at one point you detached yourself, Rom 11:23, &quot;God is able to graft them (you) again&quot; Are you completely grafted on Him? are your fruits a result of that grafting?. Lord I thank you for some of my enemies who have allowed me to experience you in a more dynamic way.<\/p>\n<p>Happy Easter<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Romans 11:16-24, &quot;Thou wilt say then, the branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in&quot; It&#39;s very easy to be hard on our enemies especially when something good is involved.

Hebrew custom establishes the idea that Jewish parents name their children based on certain characteristics. Barabbas means &quot;son of the fathers&quot;; that is, &quot;Bar&quot; means son and &quot;abbas&quot; means fathers. Growing up, I bet Barabbas thought he was something special. He was the hope of Jewish history (son of the fathers). His name suggests that the Jewish nation had a lot riding on his shoulders (son of the fathers). Barabbas was the product of the long line of Jewish wise men and sages (son of the fathers). He embodied and represented them. Little is known about his parents other than that they were political figures and did not raise him themselves. It is said that Barabbas was raised by the community- being groomed for a purpose. He was not raised with a lot of discipline.<\/p>\n<p>Historically, Barabbas came on the scene during the interim between the old and new testaments. At that time, the Jewish people were subject to Roman power. Some said that Barabbas was a &#39;robin hood&#39; character. He was hot-headed, quick tempered, and had little difficulty using violence to accomplish his goals. To him, the end justified the means and he didn&#39;t mind doing whatever he wanted, whenever, or by whatever means necessary. This lifestyle got Barabbas on Rome&#39;s top ten list of wanted men. He had led a revolt in which several Roman soldiers were killed. He had stolen from the roman and Jewish treasuries. He was known for ambushing people and taking their belongings to finance the initiatives of his motley crew. And, interestingly, we find him (the son of the fathers) in Roman custody when he is first mentioned in the gospels.<\/p>\n<p>Romans kept their notorious criminals in a jail that was located in the garrison of soldiers. This jail would be equivalent of the maximum-security prisons of today. This jail was about a half mile from the governor&#39;s palace and tribunal.<\/p>\n<p>The story opens with the Roman governor judging the case of Jesus. And, the governor gives the people a choice of choosing Jesus, the Son of God, or, Barabbas, the son of the fathers. Jesus was divine, Barabbas was not. Jesus was Son to God the Father and heir to heaven, Barabbas was son of human people and heir to a collapsed history and dejected people. Jesus represented choosing the divine while Barabbas represented choosing the least admirable qualities in us all. Truly, there was no comparison and the obvious choice of the people should have been to choose Jesus. Instead, the Jewish people chose Barabbas; the lesser figure, the substitute, the crook, the man.<\/p>\n<p>But, this is not where I want us to contemplate. Let&#39;s contemplate the story as it unfolds from the viewpoint of Barabbas. He was locked up about a half mile from where Jesus was at. From where he was located, Barabbas could hear the words of the crowd as they shout their responses in unison.<\/p>\n<p>I live less than a mile from RFK stadium, the home of Washington&#39;s field sports programs. While I don&#39;t hear the referees, I can easily hear the crowd shouting &quot;touch-down&quot; or &quot;de-fense&quot;. I can tell what&#39;s going on because I can hear the crowds&#39; woes and their happiness.<\/p>\n<p>So, here&#39;s Barabbas- locked up in jail. Now, remember, he could hear the crowds shouting in unison &#8211; but he couldn&#39;t hear the governor. He hears the crowds scream:<\/p>\n<li>Not this man, but Barabbas<\/li>\n<li>Crucify him, crucify him<\/li>\n<li>We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God<\/li>\n<li>If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar&#39;s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar<\/li>\n<li>Away with him, away with him, crucify him<\/li>\n<li>His blood be on us, and on our children.Can you imagine what was going on in the mind of Barabbas? He had been in custody for a long time. He had not seen the face of another common person nor had he had a visitor in years. By this time, he was accustom to seeing the routine faces of the roman guards. No doubt he thought that the people had betrayed him- after all, he did all of his bad deeds FOR them, right? How dare they turn on him like this? He just heard the death sentence be pronounced on him. Now, imagine the dread and the fear that seized his soul. Imagine what the other prisoners thought or said to their &quot;champion&quot; as they heard the sentence. No doubt a reverent, dreadful silence fell over the place. There was a long wait. And then, they heard the footsteps and the keys clinging in the distance- getting closer and louder. They heard the guards returning for Barabbas. For all intents and purposes, they all, including Barabbas, thought Barabbas was going to be summarily executed. But, something happens when the doors are opened to his cell, and the instruments of death tell him that he was free to go. Imagine the fear- yet excitement he felt as the chains and the instruments of his captivity and imprisonment were removed. Then, imagine the solemnity that gripped him when he was told or came to realize that Jesus took his place!\n<p>Application: This is the week of Christ&#39;s passion. As we reflect on these events, let&#39;s consider how many times we chose Barabbas over Jesus in our lives. Let us not forget the significance of the story. In Barabbas&#39;s mind- he was as good as dead. He heard the death sentence. But, Christ took his place. It is entirely possible that Barabbas went on to live a holy life after that. Perhaps, he realized the true meaning of the exchange and sacrifice that Christ made on HIS behalf- and it was enough to turn him around and truly live a life that was worth his dying for.<\/li>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Focus: Matt 27:1-26; Mark 15:1-15; Luke 23:1-25; John 18:39-19:16 Barabbas was a Jewish national\/zealot.

When you know your strengths, work hard on your strengths and you will see how your weaknesses will be balanced by your strengths.<\/p>\n<p>Here comes Peter and John to the temple, I am positive that this was not the first time they had been to this temple and being that this was not the first time, they must have seen this man sitting by the gate and maybe at one point they gave him money. On this particular day the two boys were broke. You will agree with me that it&#39;s much easier to give someone something tangible than something invisible. And because we at times get used to giving out tangible things, we don&#39;t see anything greater beyond, no wonder the Lord keeps on elevating us to new levels ultimately for the spirit to arise and the flesh be removed. These two men had nothing to give according to the principles of the earthly kingdom but after they looked at whom they belonged to, they realized that there was something they could offer from the heavenly Kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>Vs 4-6 And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said, &quot;look at us&quot;, so he gave attention, expecting to receive something from them. Then Peter said, &quot;silver and gold have I none but such as I have I give to you&quot;. We deal with people everyday who are looking for answers and help, well the world has taught them to burry some of their problems in programs, drinking, socializing, and trying some other new methods. Actually this has worked but only for sometime as in the end, people started looking for something new. When John and Peter showed up, they were not going to give him the same things he had always received, they decided to give him something eternal Jesus. This man must have thought, &quot;if silver and gold they do not have, what other thing better could they possibly offer me?&quot;.<\/p>\n<p>In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk. One time I stopped by Putnam Hospital to see one of my young adults, in the process of talking to him, a gentleman came in who I began to share Christ with him. As I was talking to him, three more people joined us and all I could offer them was Christ. The doctors had offered them medication, their families had offered them love, comfort, acceptance and maybe finances, I had nothing to offer them but Jesus. Each and every one of us has something to give. I used to dwell so much on what I did not have and forgot that God had placed special gifts in me that very few people have and if you look at your life too, you will see great gifts God has placed in your life, knowing our strengths help us overcome our weakness.<\/p>\n<p>Vs. 7&amp;8, And he took him by the right hand and lifted him, and immediately his feet and anklebones received strength. So he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered the temple with them walking, leaping and praising the Lord&quot;. It&#39;s one thing to offer something to someone, it&#39;s another thing to extend your hand to him or her to reach and grab it. The reason being that their faith has not matured enough to see things the way you see them. Remember that he had been in his condition since birth, being told to rise up and walk was just too much to grasp, Peter reaches to him after speaking the words and helps him rise up and walk. The moment he rises up, all he can do is leap, walk and praise the Lord, he has kissed his business goodbye as what he has just received is too good to be wasted on begging. For the first time he goes to the temple with new friends he has just met. What a blessing for someone to hear that you&#39;ve been praying for them, thinking about them, saying nice things to them and about them, if they felt that they were condemned to be in the same place forever, your actions will cause them to think twice. We as believers will many times feel like we are bound to be in the same place forever but that is okay as God knows how to send someone who will pump life into us, help us rise and keep on moving. If you&#39;ve invited some of your friends of family members to church and they have not showed up, such as you have, give it to them for one day they will see what you&#39;ve been offering and coming to church will crown it all.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone has something to give and as they also had something to give they said, &quot;Such As I Have I Give It To You&quot;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Blessed of God, Acts 3:1-26, &quot;&#8230;Then said Peter, &quot;Silver and gold have I none but such as I have, I give thee&#8230;&quot; The moment we begin to concentrate on our weakness, we loose focus as our weakness overshadows our strengths.

The bible says that in the last days God will pour out His Spirit upon all flesh and our sons and daughters will prophesy, the young men shall see visions and the old men shall dream dreams and in the last days, whoever will call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. We have an awesome opportunity to affect and be affected by what the Lord is doing through us. <\/p>\n<p>Peter and John are on their way to pray at a certain hour which happened to be the praying hour. They come to the temple and right outside the temple there is a gate called beautiful, right at the gate there is a lame man sitting out there begging for alms or in other words money. Here is a man who has been lame from his birth and everyday some people carried him to the gate. He must have had a booming business as they kept on brining him over there or that was the only place where people were generous. I bet that after sometime, the people who kept on bringing him over there must have been tired of doing so and maybe charging a fee would have made them keep on doing the job of bringing him to the gate. <\/p>\n<p>Just to continue exploring this man&#8217;s life let&#8217;s see another thing that might have happened, he must have gotten comfortable there as he couldn&#8217;t see anything beyond his situation. I wonder whether there was any time in his life that he desired to know what was actually going on in the temple, oh well the business was booming and he was comfortable, why would he want to see what was happening beyond the gates. If I look at it well, many times I could relate to this fellow as there are certain things that I kind of ruled out that nothing good could come out of it and because of that, seating by the gate called beautiful was all I could do, maybe not looking for alms but looking for acceptance, affirmation, encouragements and the like. These helped but for a short time cause next day I would need them again. Often times when you have tried something and maybe at one point you saw yourself coming out of it and months go by which turns to years, you will agree with me that it&#8217;s hard to expect a change or something different about it. <\/p>\n<p>God may take you through the desert but He will never leave you in the dessert as His promise is to bring you to the promise land. You may get comfortable around the mountain because He is providing manna and water but that is His away of sustaining you so that He can bring you to where He promised. This man&#8217;s life was being sustained for a certain time he was not aware of, he could have died before Peter and John showed up and that is also with us. As long as we are still breathing, we have to hope for something better than where we are. We all need to be packed up so that we can pass over, we are nomadic people meaning we are not scheduled to be where ever we are forever. I pray that we will never build a permanent solution on a temporary circumstance. So devil please don&#8217;t look for me where I was yesterday cause I will not be there. Where you found me was just a resting place getting me ready for the next move. I have sat by the gate for too long it&#8217;s time for me to rise and move, so don&#8217;t send me no telegram, mail or any package for I have no street address, if I have to pitch a tent, I will but come morning I will be gone. I know you are used to looking for me at the gate I have been pitying myself and begging but enough is enough. I had him say, weeping may endure for a night but joy comes in the morning, Psalm 30:5 <\/p>\n<p>People and situations may want to keep on bringing you to the gate and never inside, that&#8217;s okay. Thanks to them they brought you closer to your miracle cause God is now about to send someone who will speak a word that will cause you to see yourself through the eyes of faith and when you do so, you will kiss the gate goodbye. Something awesome will remind you that you are better than sitting at the gate asking for alms. My encouragement to us this morning is to refuse to be in the same place forever why cause my bible says, these too shall pass. No one has been in a situation for too long that the Lord cannot deal with it. 1Cor 2:9, &#8220;But as it&#8217;s written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>I will continue in the morning, have a blessed day. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Acts 3:1-26, &#8220;&#8230;Then said Peter, &#8220;Silver and gold have I none but such as I have, I give thee&#8230;&#8221; We have been allowed to be part of what the Lord is doing in these last days.

My encouragement to us this morning is to refuse to be in the same place forever why cause my bible says, these too shall pass. No one has been in a situation for too long that the Lord cannot deal with it. 1Cor 2:9, &#8220;But as it&#8217;s written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I will continue in the morning, have a blessed day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Acts 3:1-26, &#8220;&#8230;Then said Peter, &#8220;Silver and gold have I none but such as I have, I give thee&#8230;&#8221; We have been allowed to be part of what the Lord is doing in these last days.

At times however hard you try, things do get out of control. You still may not be in a position to meet the dead lines, have things in place but heaven knows you have toiled. By the end of the day you wonder what you did today yet times passed by so fast. What you are left with after the day is over is exhaustion, some headache. Looking at the root cause of how it seams to appear, you realize that it&#39;s not headache but exhaustion and fatigue. The best cure for it is not medicine, the cure for it is rest.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#39;t know about you but I am the type that will work and work for long hours trying my best to do what I should do, in the process, I find that I have pushed rest out of my normal routine, in the end I appear to be having a headache. In Genesis 15:1 the Lord appears to Abram in a vision and His words to him is, &quot;Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward&quot;. In one line he is given one instruction and two promises. In other words, do not be afraid if you do not finish all you needed to do, don&#39;t feel bad that you failed to accomplish it why? because I am your shield. Believe it or not, no one understands what resting is all about like God. He created the earth in 6 days and on the 7th day He chilled and rested. His word to Abram is that I am your shield, protecting you from all that make you exhausted, bring fatigue, those things that appear to be like headache because I have called you into rest. God also tells Him that He is Abram&#39;s exceedingly great reward which I would interpret, the best you do, God rewards it. We do the best we can with the help of God, we live the rest for Him to handle as we go to rest. Abram upon hearing those encouraging words that he can do his best and not do everything and that God rewards those who work hard, Vs. 2, &quot;But Abram said, &quot;Lord, what will You give me, seeing I go childless&#8230; vs. 3, &quot;Then Abram said, &quot;look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one born in my house is my heir&quot;. Here is a man who knows the Lord, God has made promises that He will fulfill, he has done his best but desires an offspring who will rise from his family and continue to display what God had started through him.<\/p>\n<p>Vs. 9, &quot;So He (God) said to him, &quot;Bring Me three year old heifer, a three year old female goat, a three year old ram, a turtle dove, and a young pigeon&quot;. I don&#39;t understand why the Lord wanted all this, all I do understand that obedience is the key to unlock the promises. The bible says that whatever good we do, we do it unto the Lord, be it serving people, trying our best to accomplish our assignments and goals, we are all doing this unto the Lord. Some of them don&#39;t make sense and you and I wonder why we have to do them but still the obedience to do it unto the Lord is the key. Mathew 5:16, &quot;Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven&quot;. Doing good is representing God in the fallen world, we represent Him as a good God. Remember those days that you don&#39;t really feel like doing good, you want to do the worse, the day is not promising but you still do good anyway? that must have been with Abram doing what the Lord asked him to do. So he cut the animals but did not cut the birds and for the whole day all he tried to do was protect what he was offering to God. Genesis 15:11, &quot;And when the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away&quot;. I see this everyday when I offer myself to God for service, what happens? vultures of fear, frustrations, confusion, anger try to come in and for the whole day, I am chasing them away to protect that which I am offering to the Lord partially because the bible says, Romans 12:1, &quot;Brethren I beseech you by the mercies of God that you present yourself a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable which is your reasonable service&quot;. The moment you surrender yourself as a sacrifice, all the vultures will be out to devour that sacrifice but chase the vultures away for His word says again, do not be weary in well doing.<\/p>\n<p>When you have done all you can, the Lord takes over and gives you rest in the spirit, body, soul, mind. Vs 12, &quot;Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram&quot;. You cannot sleep when you are troubled. Those who are troubled will be tossing back and forth on their bed, wondering of what they could have done better, how they missed the deadlines but here is a man who did the best he can and God gave him deep sleep, a time to rest while He takes care of the rest. Remember the Lord said to him in the beginning, &quot;I am your shield&quot;. When you have done your best, close out everything, commend the rest to God and go to sleep, relax, enjoy doing other things that bring you joy and helps you gain your strength back. Even with ministry, at times it&#39;s good to go underground, relax, do things you like to do outside ministry, Ecclesiastes 5:18, &quot;It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor in which he toils under the sun all the days of his life which God gives him; for it is his heritage&quot;. God gives us all good things to enjoy but that cannot happen to a troubled person, it happens to those who have done their best and have committed the rest to the Lord. Therefore rest and let God handle your rest and the rest that you need to do.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Genesis 15:9-12, &quot;And when the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away&quot; You and I knows those times when we have so much to do and we want to do it all well.

Millions of dollars are poured into commercials with an aim to create an awareness of the latest products. The commercials are suppose to be catchy and you will agree with me of how many of them are funny, some with twisted humor. To some, hoping their commercials will sell. Why do people go for things they go for, either someone told them about it and convinced them that it works or they saw it on TV, heard it on radio, through bill boards, news papers and they got utterly convinced that is what they needed. The product will not do them much if they don&#39;t try it. For a fact, most of the commercials exaggerate what their products can do only to discover that it works for a short time and it&#39;s effectiveness is gone.<\/p>\n<p>What does this have to do with what I am about to talk about, they all come back to being aware and putting that awareness into practice. We have talked about faith so many times but let this help build your faith. Faith is the confident belief in the truth, value, worthiness of a person, idea or a thing. It&#39;s being loyal to a person or a thing. If you told me your name, I must have faith to believe that you have told me the truth. If I said, &quot;I don&#39;t believe you&quot;, you will get offended because I am insinuating that you are deceiving me with a name you have given. If you told me about where you live and I doubted it with you knowing, you will not take it kindly. What does Paul say about the author of faith in Hebrews 11:6, &quot;For without faith it is impossible to please God&#8230;&quot;. You want to please God, you got have faith, faith in believing what He has said without doubting. The moment there is doubt, it&#39;s an indication of mistrust, and what an insult that is to God too. He has displayed his products to us inform of creation, He has seen us through over and over again therefore He is God who can be trusted, have faith in Him.<\/p>\n<p>Faith is commitment. When the bible talks about FAITHFUL servant, it refers to one who is committed to a task because he has believed in the one who authored that task. It&#39;s away to build more faith because the person whom you hang around for long, their character is displayed, you have a better way of dealing with them when it comes to faith. It&#39;s evident when you look at certain people, you don&#39;t have faith in them, you cannot trust them with things like information or finances because they have no character to support that trust. Thanks be to God who is faithful, never leaks your information to someone else, does not mess with what you have trusted Him with. The children of God are people of faith, committed to this walk of life with Christ, 2Corinthians 5:7, &quot;For we walk by faith and not by sight&quot;. It&#39;s a tough one but we are determined to ride it out because we want to please Him.<\/p>\n<p>He that uses the product must first believe that it works and what is the testimony? I don&#39;t think faith just appears from nowhere and we believe it. It comes by hearing, hearing someone&#39;s testimony that God can, hearing the word that drills through the nutshell of doubt and unbelief. The continuous word spoken goes around that shell and begins to melt it down allowing it to have a new master FAITH (Forever All In Thy Hand). You can only come to someone because you know they have it, Christ does have it forever in His hands. Doubt is the an enemy of faith and it&#39;s comes easily, but faith needs a lot of force to occupy. Faith is gradual concurring one step at a time depending on what it&#39;s given to feed on. We have established what faith comes by, &quot;Hearing&quot;, this presents a little problem because you could hear things but wrong things and for sure those can also build faith but only towards the wrong things. &quot;It comes by hearing by the word of God&quot;. God&#39;s word is like the commercial that we see out there, the only difference is that His word are not exaggerated, nothing can be added to it and nothing can be taken away from it. It presents it self, defends it self and also proves itself. It never fails, it does not work for a season, it works always. It does not fall short of anything and it does not return void. What it starts, it will accomplish it. It&#39;s committed through the author to accomplish what it&#39;s meant for. When the word of God finds it&#39;s way into our hearts, it shoots faith with it to melt every doubt and unbelief to create room itself. Don&#39;t forget that faith draws a man to God. . Having faith in someone who you know cannot do it is being unwise, last time I checked God, I found that there is nothing impossible with Him, that He is Hebrews 12:2, &quot;..author and the finisher of our faith&#8230;&quot;<\/p>\n<p>One little thing about faith and we are done for today. At your desk, you have your chair right? You can see from a distance that it can hold you. You have faith that it can hold you because either you have seen someone sit on it before and did not fall, or you look at it and you can see it&#39;s stability or you have sat on it before and therefore you have faith that it can do the job. Currently why is it not holding you? it&#39;s because you are not sitting on it. There are people who have faith that God can work in their lives but they are not experiencing that, why? because they believe from distance. The moment you make that step and sit on that chair, you would have shifted your faith and made it complete. Staying on it, makes you comfortable. As you sit on it, it will do the job of holding you, is this not what Christ is also offering us?, Hebrews 11:6,&quot;&#8230;He that comes to God must first believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him&quot;. Let your faith be boosted because you have heard the word.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Romans 10:17, &quot;So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God&quot; Commercials are one of the greatest tools the manufacturers use to convey messages about their new products in the market.

Pilate asks a previous question in v. 9 &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. But when Pilate says &quot;Don&#39;t you realize I have the power&#8230;,&quot; Jesus speaks up boldly. &quot;You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above.&quot; What is he saying? YOU THINK YOU HAVE POWER OVER ME! NOBODY TAKES MY LIFE FROM ME I FREELY LAY IT DOWN. YOU THINK YOU&#39;RE RUNNING THIS? YOU&#39;RE NOT RUNNING THIS, I&#39;M RUNNING THIS. YOU&#39;RE IN CHARGE BUT YOU&#39;RE NOT RUNNING ANYTHING, I&#39;M RUNNING THIS. I&#39;m orchestrating this; this is in my Father&#39;s divine will.<\/p>\n<p>THIS IS THE GREAT ISSUE OF KINGDOM COMMUNICATOIN. Jesus is saying, I&#39;m not talking about power, I&#39;m talking about power. Everybody wants power, everybody wants a kingdom, this is not talking about power, and not about a kingdom, rather it&#39;s about a kingdom, and power.<\/p>\n<p>Peter is struggling with this issue, &quot;Lord are you going to give us the power? Jesus says, &quot;I hear you and I hear your question, but I sense you&#39;re talking about power, I&#39;m not talking about power, I&#39;m talking about power. You&#39;re not going to receive the power that you are thinking about, that&#39;s all in God&#39;s time. But I will give you power!&quot;<\/p>\n<p>This whole issue over power comes to light in churches, marriages, vocations, etc&#8230;. Many church splits are over power struggles on the color of the carpet. They are so focused on the idea of power being the same as that of the disciples before they really understood what Jesus really meant by power. But the sad thing is when people use the language of the kingdom, for their own agenda.<\/p>\n<p>When Old Granny Wilson says, &quot;Thus saith the Lord that music is too loud&quot; she her own opinion and comforts with the will of God. This is the classic use of spiritual language to end the argument. When one says &quot;THUS SAITH THE LORD,&quot; how can anyone argue with that?<\/p>\n<p>This type of thinking turns the Gifts of the Spirit into a Pentecostal Poker game. One says &quot;I have a vision.&quot; The next one says &quot;I see your vision, but I have 3 dreams, that&#39;s a FULL HOUSE. Understand it becomes a jockeying for power. It&#39;s really no different then when a 2 year old jerks her hand out of her mother&#39;s hand and runs across a busy street putting their life in danger. And because this jockeying for power spirit shows up in so many institutions, this sprit can affect, a country, a church, a marriage, a family or a life. Many Christians are saying &quot;LORD WHEN DO I GET THE POWER.&quot; Let me give you a powerful illustration.<\/p>\n<p>ILLUSTRATION<\/p>\n<p>There was a 16 year old girl, about 1,000 miles from Beijing. She&#39;s beaten senseless, gang raped by hear guards, and has her fingernails torn out with a pair of pliers. And they throw into a prison cell and she presses her face against the bars, and says, &quot;God loves you, I love you, and after what you&#39;ve done to me today, you&#39;ll never be able to sleep tonight, so let me sing to you the songs of Zion.&quot; And she sings to her guards, until their hearts are melted to God. They have the guns, they have the uniforms, they have the keys, they have the power, and THEY ARE POWERLESS BEFORE HER. She has nothing, she has nothing, as a bankrupt prisoner of an oppressive prison, but she is in total control; she has the power in which Jesus spoke of.<\/p>\n<p>In Acts 1:8 Jesus was saying I am giving you power to live, to die, and to live with integrity, as you are my faithful witnesses in a world that hates Me, yet that nevertheless need Me. I&#39;m sending you into the world defenseless (physical power), as sheep among wolves, but I&#39;m not going to let you be harmed. They may torture you and kill you, but I&#39;m not going to let anything happen to you. You may die but you&#39;re not going to DIE. But, when the Holy Spirit comes on you, I&#39;ll give you power, more and greater then anything you&#39;d ever imagine.

He appeared to them over a period of forty days and  spoke about the kingdom of God.&quot; Acts 1:3<\/p>\n<p>Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples  when Jesus came. So the other disciples told him, &quot;We have seen the Lord!&quot; But  he said to them, &quot;Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger  where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.&quot;  (John 20:24-25)<\/p>\n<p>They said, I can&#39;t take this anymore, He&#39;s king, He&#39;s not, He&#39;s alive, He&#39;s  dead, He&#39;s a live again, He loves me, He loves me not, they said I can&#39;t do this  anymore. Thomas even expresses it, he basically says &quot;I can&#39;t live in this up  and down way anymore; I will not believe this until I put my hand in His side,  until I put my fingers through the nail scares. I can&#39;t live like this, He&#39;s the  Messiah, He&#39;s not, He heals the sick, He raises the dead, He is dead, and then  He&#39;s not dead. I just can&#39;t do this!&quot; A week later, Jesus walks through the  wall, and says &quot;here touch that&quot;. Thomas says, &quot;no Lord I don&#39;t need to do that  now.&quot; Jesus says, no you said it, you&#39;re going to do it. This was the same  Thomas that earlier said to Jesus and the disciples, &quot;Let us also go, that we  may die with him.&quot; (John 11:6) What a shift in language from Thomas, from dying  to doubting.<\/p>\n<p>Do you see this whole conversation, is an issue of miscommunication? They&#39;re  thinking KINGDOM; the Davidic dynasty reestablished, with its geopolitical,  socioeconomic, and religious center at Jerusalem. They see Jesus on the throne  and themselves ruling and reigning with Him 1,000 yrs. What did Isaiah say, &quot;you  shall you the nations with a rod of iron,&quot; and they think the Romans ruled us  with a rod of iron, now they feel it&#39;s their turn to rule the Romans with a rod  of iron and they can&#39;t wait.<\/p>\n<p>Now here&#39;s Jesus, He&#39;s alive again, and He spends the next 40 days talking to  them about the kingdom of God. And the Disciples are probably thinking, &quot;This is  it, what a joker Jesus is, he really played a joke on the Romans. NOW COMES THE  KINGDOM!&quot; Jesus says, &quot;Not many days from now you shall receive the promise of  the Father. (Acts 1:4-5) Again they are thinking wrong, as they are hearing the  promise of the Father as a physical power statement. So they ask, &quot;Wilt thou at  this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?&quot; They are feeling &quot;This is it, we  are finally going to have a great new DAVID in a new JERUSALEM, and with a NEW  THRONE, and a SWORD, and we&#39;ll rule and reign, and not Caesar, but KING JESUS.  And I can picture Jesus looking intently at them and saying, &quot;NO&quot;.<\/p>\n<p>This whole issue is one of miscommunication. Remember when Jesus was UNDER  ARREST BY PILATE. Pilate basically said &quot;LOOK, I LIKE YOU, I DON&#39;T WANT TO KILL  YOU. ARE YOU A KING? THESE PEOPLE TELL ME YOU&#39;RE CLAIMING TO BE A KING. ARE YOU  A KING OR NOT.&quot; Jesus replies knowing that Pilate will not understand. In the  vernacular Jesus responds &quot;Yes, I am a king, but I&#39;m not a king like Cesar a  king, I&#39;m a king. Cesar has an army, his army has, swords, I have an army my  army has swords. But my army doesn&#39;t fight like his army fights, my army fights,  and we&#39;re not going to conquer anything, we&#39;re going to be more then conquers.&quot;  Can you imagine what is going through Pilate&#39;s mind? But ultimately Pilate does  not want to kill Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>Application: Ask people if they have seen the Passion of the Christ. If they  have or have not, ask them what does the crucifixion of Christ mean and how does  it affect their lives now.<\/p>\n<p>Until the nets are filled&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Blessings,<\/p>\n<p>Pastor Phil &lt;&gt;&lt;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good Morning, May you enjoy part 4 of Communicating the Kingdom. &quot;After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive.

He appeared to them over a period of forty days and  spoke about the kingdom of God.&quot; Acts 1:3<\/p>\n<p>As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethpage on the Mount of Olives,  Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them, &quot;Go to the village ahead of you, and  at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and  bring them to me. Matt 21:1-2<\/p>\n<p>Now they come to Jerusalem, Jesus descends from the Mt. Of Olives toward the  Eastern Gate, the people are joyous in their expression. And their language to  His presence is very intriguing. They express the great contemporary hope for  the coming of Messiah, Kingship. And they are shouting &quot;Hosanna to the King that  comes in the name of the Lord!&quot; Hosanna doesn&#39;t mean Hallelujah, Hosanna means  save us now. They were saying King save us now! Were they saying save us from  our sins? NO, not at this point, they wanted Him to save them from the Romans<\/p>\n<p>The Romans are just across the Kidron Valley watching out of the Towers of  the Antonio Fortress. That&#39;s the reason that the Pharisees are telling Jesus  Master, make the people be quiet, they are going to get us all killed. The  Romans are going to rush out of that fortress and kill us all. There is only one  King, and his name is Caesar.<\/p>\n<p>This whole issue explodes into the lives of the disciples, especially the  Apostles that are saying, &quot;This is it, this is the time.&quot; And they are feeling  Jesus giving the idea that He has establish not only political leadership, but  religious leadership. What is His first act? Jesus goes into the Temple and  drives the money changers out, as if to say this also is mine. He says this &quot;My  house and it will be a house of prayer.&quot; He claims authority, and that authority  is even yielded to. Why didn&#39;t they just throw Jesus out, there were more of  them, then there was of Him. Maybe they in part feared the people. Maybe because  they thought, &quot;don&#39;t mess with this guy, He acts like He owns the place.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>The disciples meanwhile are triumphant in their thoughts. They are thinking  this is it, &quot;He is going to establish His kingdom.&quot; We know this is what they  were thinking, because remember Zebede&#39;s wife, mother of James and John, came to  Jesus and said, &quot;When you come into your kingdom, let my sons sit on either side  of you&quot; (Mt. 20:20-21). Everyone wants Jesus to have the big chair, one big  throne, nobody wants that. But she&#39;s thinking there are going to be six little  chairs on either side of him, why not claim those. And the other Apostles are  furious at James and John&#39;s mother, why, because she infringed upon divine  authority? No because she beat them to the punch. They want those chairs, and  are jockeying for position. Did they not ask at one point, &quot;Who is the greatest  in the Kingdom of heaven?&quot; (Mt. 18:1) As kingdom authority is about to come,  they are thinking that He is going to come like an Arnold Swartnegger, and blow  the mean old Romans out of the water. Maybe He&#39;ll nail Pilate to the walls of  Jerusalem, as he had the previous year nailed 600 Jews to the walls of  Jerusalem.<\/p>\n<p>What does Jesus do instead? He retires to a place of pray, allows He to be  arrested, He&#39;s crucified, dead, buried, and as the stone is rolled across the  grave, and entombed with Him are all their hopes of Messianic kingdom. It&#39;s  over, it&#39;s was a nice ride, but its&#39; over, all hope is lost and buried in that  tomb. Now all of a sudden, 3 days later, the women are talking, we&#39;ve seen Him,  He&#39;s alive. I mean come on, you want to believe that, you&#39;d like to believe  that, but you know how historical these women could get they&#39;re thinking.  Furthermore, how much sense does it make? He is going to appear to an ex-hooker  (Mary Magdalene) in a cemetery? I don&#39;t think so. I wouldn&#39;t have done that. If  I rise from the dead I know where I&#39;m going, Ciaphe&#39;s bedroom, and I&#39;ll say,  &quot;I&#39;m back!&quot; What if He walked through the walls of Pilate&#39;s house, and said  &quot;SURPRISE!&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Application: When all looks hopeless and you feel not even God is there, yet  you have been faithful, hang on, because not all hope is lost, or as Evans would  say the best is yet to come!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good Morning,Please enjoy part 3 of the series, Commmunicating the Kingdom. &quot;After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive.

They were not students of the law, Bible scholars, or  theologian level minded people. These were ordinary, working class people, blue  collared fisherman with calluses on their hands, and calluses on their brains.  And into their lives SUDDENLY EXPLODES THE LONG AWAITED HOPE OF ISRAEL. Jesus  chooses in our eyes, a highly unlikely group to make into His team that would  turn the world upside down for Him.<\/p>\n<p>Isn&#39;t it comforting that &quot;God chooses the foolish things of this world, to  confound the wise?&quot; As the statement goes, &quot;Lord if You can use anyone Lord, You  can use me&quot;. These people were not acting out of script. Sometimes, at least at  a subconscious level, I think we believe that these men were acting out of  script. Peter is washing his nets by the Sea of Galilee, sees Jesus walking up  the beach and says, oh Matt chap. 6. These men are experiencing this all for the  very first time. They don&#39;t have the benefit of 2,000 years of Bible teaching as  we do. We are blessed on one hand to be able to see through hindsight, but they  couldn&#39;t. And they spend the next 3 years asking one fundamental question, &quot;Who  is this guy?&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Jesus projects the question in Matt 16:13 that He knows they are wondering,  as He states, WHO DO MEN say that I the Son of man am? They respond by sharing  the majority view, the people&#39;s opinion. Some say you are John the Baptist:  some, Elijah, (YOU&#39;RE NOT ELIJIAH ARE YOU); others, Jeremiah, or one of the  prophets. They don&#39;t know what to think. Then Jesus puts the bulls eye right on  them, and fires the question, &quot;BUT WHO DO YOU say that I am?&quot; Now He&#39;s seeing if  the men who had been walking with Him all along, have a clue about His identity.<\/p>\n<p>And what happens, but good old Simone Peter opened his mouth as usual. Peter  was one who was known for speaking up when he should shut up; stand up when he  should sit down, etc&#8230; He says, I know who you are; &quot;You&#39;re the Christ, the Son  of the living God. BINGO, Peter got it right finally. But, I can imagine  everyone freezing, expecting Jesus to smite Peter in the mouth, which was the  ancient symbol for blasphemy. Does Jesus smite him, indeed not? He says you&#39;re  right; the Father has given you a faith revelation. Well there it is the cats  out of the bag, Jesus is known as Messiah, Son of God.<\/p>\n<p>Application: How did you receive the revelation that He is the Messiah?

He appeared to them over a period of forty days and  spoke about the kingdom of God (Acts 1:3).&quot;<\/p>\n<p>This is the passage of Scripture occurs between the resurrection and the  ascension, in the 40-day span of time that Jesus has been raised from the dead,  but not yet ascended to the right hand of the Father.<\/p>\n<p>For 40 days this resurrected Christ teaches them basically on one topic: The  Kingdom of God. He could have spoken any topic, but why did He choose to speak  only on this one topic? Because a King always speaks about His Kingdom &#8211; AMEN!  And so Jesus really is the first cross-cultural missionary, leaving his home in  glory, taking the form of man, and attempting to explain heavenly transcendent  truth<\/p>\n<p>Acts 1:6 &quot;So when they met together, they asked him, &quot;Lord, are you at this  time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?&#39;&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Can you see that you can draw a line between their conclusion\/question and  His 40 days of ministry? He has been teaching them about the Kingdom. And their  thinking &quot;this is it, this is the time that you are going to restore the  kingdom, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<\/p>\n<p>AC 1:7 He said to them: &quot;It is not for you to know the times or dates the  Father has set by his own authority. 8 But you will receive power when the Holy  Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea  and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&quot;<\/p>\n<p>Here is Jesus&#39; response focuses on two components, time and power. The  disciples wanted King Jesus to be like the Hulk, or the Terminator and crush the  Romans under His thumb, just as the Israelites had been under the thumb of the  Romans, and they thought he would do it with an iron scepter.<\/p>\n<p>I can&#39;t imagine that there has ever been a group of people whose emotions  have endured a more dread itineration that the Apostles. It is hard for us to  empathize what they dealing with. However, at least we can realize that these  were not people that were in some way intellectually, emotionally, relationally,  or even spiritually prepared for the events which ERRPUTED into their lives.  What did they hear about Jesus, He&#39;s king, He&#39;s not, He&#39;s alive, He&#39;s dead, He&#39;s  alive again, He loves me, He loves me not, they said I can&#39;t do this anymore.  Jesus is saying to these guys, &quot;OK guys you think this whole thing is about  power, it&#39;s not about power, it&#39;s about POWER!<\/p>\n<p>Do you see this whole conversation, is an issue of miscommunication? They&#39;re  thinking KINGDOM; the Davidic dynasty reestablished, with it&#39;s geopolitical,  socioeconomic, and religious center at Jerusalem. Jesus in the throne and they  ruling and reigning with Him 1,000 yrs. What did Isa. Say, &quot;you shall you the  nations with a rod of iron,&quot; they ruled us with a rod of iron, THAT SOUNDS GOOD  TO ME, I CAN&quot;T WAIT! And isn&#39;t that so like us, we all want power, but our means  of getting it is usually through manipulation, deception, or intimidation. The  power the disciples were thinking of, and the power Jesus was promising, were  from two totally different perspectives, and realms.

There had to be a death experience before there was resurrection victory. Death could not hold or contain Him, sin tried but He conquered the day that death was crucified. 1 Corinthians 15:55, &quot;O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?&quot; O Death, where is your victory? O Death, where is your sting?. Jesus came back to life, complete and whole, the original Jesus but there was something that He came back with and that is the scars. The marks of nails on His hands and feet and the mark of where they pierced Him on His side. I have often wondered why those marks did not disappear at His resurrection. I believe they would serve as a reminder to us of what He had to go through for us to be saved, also proof to those who had a problem believing like Thomas. He was wounded for our transgressions according to Isaiah 53:5 yet in His coming back to life He did not have wounds but scars.<\/p>\n<p>Scars ought to be reminders but many treat them as wounds. They go about poking the scars bringing back the wounds that were already healed. Are you living a condemned life over what God had forgiven you off and given you freedom to live for Him? The scars which is your history is not a wound but a reminder of where He called you from. Whenever I remember where He called me from, I get so humbled to the fact that He saw my need and picked me up from the miry clay when no one else could. I don&#39;t use the reminders to condemn myself, I use the reminders to thank Him for what He did for me on the cross. I&#39;m glad that even though He saved me, He did not take away my scars (history) and because of that, this scripture comes alive Romans 8:1, &quot;There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus,&#8230;&quot;. Those who are in Christ have their sins washed way by the blood of the Lamb. The blood of the Lamb is the only blood that could screen the sin when nothing else could. The blood of the Lamb is the only blood that not only took care of what I did, it also took care of what almost did and what I could have ever done. The blood handled many worse things we could have done had He not come soon enough. It took care of the past, present and future. Water is suppose to take care of what is dirty and nothing more, it will not wash away any dirt that is not there, the blood goes beyond. Because we are washed by the blood, yes we might still have scars seen but we will not feel condemned anymore as they are not wounds. Psalm 103:12, &quot;As far as the east is from the west, So far has He removed our transgressions from us&quot;. You might remind the Lord of your past sin but He chooses to remember it no more because He forgave you of it.<\/p>\n<p>Lord if You chose to leave the scars on Your body when You came back to life, Help me live with the scars of where you called me from. No more will I treat them as wounds as I am not condemned anymore now that I live for You.<\/p>\n<p>Be blessed Ev<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning, Romans 8:1, &quot;There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit&quot; Resurrection Sunday is a Sunday that depicts the victory of Jesus over death when He rose from the dead.

What I see may not be what you see; what I deal with may not be what you deal with but we are all seeing things differently and deal with things differently. What is the truth we all need to see?.<\/p>\n<p>Stephen was known as a man of faith and full of the Holy Spirit. There was such a massive power invested in him and with that he did great wonders and signs among the people. Very few people liked what he did as most of them conspired to kill him. Those who conspired to kill him first thought of disputing him, Acts 6:8, says, &quot;And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke&quot;. According to 1Peter 3:15, he was ready, which says &quot;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason for the hope that is in you with meekness and fear&quot;. Stephen knew who his God was, what had been invested in him and he was not afraid to defend his faith. He had seen what many had not seen and therefore standing out there, he was able to give them a glimpse of what standing for the truth was all about. There are and will be people who will try and challenge your faith in Christ by trying to ask questions, what kind of stand will you take? Romans 1:16, &quot;For I am not a shamed of the gospel of Christ: for it&#39;s the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes&#8230;&quot;. They lied on him but he stood firm and defended his faith which later led his death. Having encounterd with Christ, they that saw him did not see an ordinary man, Acts 6:15, &quot;And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel&quot;. What an awesome opportunity for the people to see him as a man who has encountered with the Lord. He has faith, the Holy Spirit, wisdom, boldness and a shinning face all that come from above. Do people see all these when they encounter with you? Stephen&#39;s continuous connection gave him a chance to tap from the heavenly sources that in turn may be revealed to the people.<\/p>\n<p>He takes the time to take the people back to history from the time of Abraham and he covers everything even how the people killed all those who brought the good news. The more the people heard what he had to say, the more they wanted to tear him apart. Acts 7:55, &quot;But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory go God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, vs. 56, &quot;Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!&quot;. Glory be to God, when you know your reason is all about, though you may share with people the truth, many will not see what you see. Stephen is not frustrated because these people are not seeing what he is seeing, they have already seen his shinning face, he is giving them a chance to see where he is getting strength from. Do not be frustrated because people are not seeing what you are seeing, even Elisha had a servant who began to panic because those who were about attack them. Meanwhile Elisha remained calmed for he had seen what his servant had not seen. Instead of him being frustrated with his servant, he prayed to God to open the eyes of his servant to see what he was seeing. I&#39;m working on this part for there are times I would like people especially the unsaved to see what I am seeing and it&#39;s tough and can be frustrating, my prayer is that God will open their eyes to see what I see, Jesus sitting on the throne ruling forever and ever.<\/p>\n<p>Acts 7:58, &quot;And they cast him out of the city and stoned him. vs. 59, &quot;And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God saying, &quot;Lord Jesus receive my Spirit&quot;. With His eyes gazing into heaven though he was being stoned, he remained calm and called on God. You can be stoned with words, be ridiculed, be put down and these things can be hurting but as Stephen, look to heaven. Acts 7:60, &quot;Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, &quot;Lord, do not charge them with this sin&quot;. And when he had said this, he fell as a sleep&quot;. Because what he had seen that people did not see, he couldn&#39;t blame them for their actions all he prayed about was forgiveness. Jesus did the same hanging on the cross, those who crucified him did not know what they were doing. If they understood who Jesus was and is, they would have thought twice. Forgive those who stone you with their words, those who talk ill about your faith, those who reject the truth for they haven&#39;t seen the light. Remember that they may not see what you see but what they see in you will not be denied. Saul (Paul) was present at the stoning of Stephen, actually he was carrying all the garments of those who stoned Stephen. It&#39;s not recorded but I believe that Stephen&#39;s last moments must have impacted him in away. A man of God not afraid to be stoned for the sake of Christ. Where he was going could not be compared to where he had come from and there was no reason to hold anything inside. Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing!.

Those who conspired to kill him first thought of disputing him, Acts 6:8, says, &quot;And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke&quot;. According to 1Peter 3:15, he was ready, which says &quot;But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason for the hope that is in you with meekness and fear&quot;. Stephen knew who his God was, what had been invested in him and he was not afraid to defend his faith. He had seen what many had not seen and therefore standing out there, he was able to give them a glimpse of what standing for the truth was all about. There are and will be people who will try and challenge your faith in Christ by trying to ask questions, what kind of stand will you take? Romans 1:16, &quot;For I am not a shamed of the gospel of Christ: for it&#39;s the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes&#8230;&quot;. They lied on him but he stood firm and defended his faith which later led his death. Having encounterd with Christ, they that saw him did not see an ordinary man, Acts 6:15, &quot;And all who sat in the council, looking steadfastly at him, saw his face as the face of an angel&quot;. What an awesome opportunity for the people to see him as a man who has encountered with the Lord. He has faith, the Holy Spirit, wisdom, boldness and a shinning face all that come from above. Do people see all these when they encounter with you? Stephen&#39;s continuous connection gave him a chance to tap from the heavenly sources that in turn may be revealed to the people.<\/p>\n<p>He takes the time to take the people back to history from the time of Abraham and he covers everything even how the people killed all those who brought the good news. The more the people heard what he had to say, the more they wanted to tear him apart. Acts 7:55, &quot;But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory go God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, vs. 56, &quot;Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!&quot;. Glory be to God, when you know your reason is all about, though you may share with people the truth, many will not see what you see. Stephen is not frustrated because these people are not seeing what he is seeing, they have already seen his shinning face, he is giving them a chance to see where he is getting strength from. Do not be frustrated because people are not seeing what you are seeing, even Elisha had a servant who began to panic because those who were about attack them. Meanwhile Elisha remained calmed for he had seen what his servant had not seen. Instead of him being frustrated with his servant, he prayed to God to open the eyes of his servant to see what he was seeing. I&#39;m working on this part for there are times I would like people especially the unsaved to see what I am seeing and it&#39;s tough and can be frustrating, my prayer is that God will open their eyes to see what I see, Jesus sitting on the throne ruling forever and ever.<\/p>\n<p>Acts 7:58, &quot;And they cast him out of the city and stoned him. vs. 59, &quot;And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God saying, &quot;Lord Jesus receive my Spirit&quot;. With His eyes gazing into heaven though he was being stoned, he remained calm and called on God. You can be stoned with words, be ridiculed, be put down and these things can be hurting but as Stephen, look to heaven. Acts 7:60, &quot;Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, &quot;Lord, do not charge them with this sin&quot;. And when he had said this, he fell as a sleep&quot;. Because what he had seen that people did not see, he couldn&#39;t blame them for their actions all he prayed about was forgiveness. Jesus did the same hanging on the cross, those who crucified him did not know what they were doing. If they understood who Jesus was and is, they would have thought twice. Forgive those who stone you with their words, those who talk ill about your faith, those who reject the truth for they haven&#39;t seen the light. Remember that they may not see what you see but what they see in you will not be denied. Saul (Paul) was present at the stoning of Stephen, actually he was carrying all the garments of those who stoned Stephen. It&#39;s not recorded but I believe that Stephen&#39;s last moments must have impacted him in away. A man of God not afraid to be stoned for the sake of Christ. Where he was going could not be compared to where he had come from and there was no reason to hold anything inside. Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing!. Keep seeing what many haven&#39;t seen yet!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Acts 7:54-60, &quot;Look!

These believers were not part of the generation of Moses and were not parties to the mighty acts of God in that day. Among all that God had done, nothing was so spectacular as the bondage and absolute deliverance of the Israelis from Egypt. Egypt was the lone world sovereign state. The pharaoh of Egypt exercised unlimited prerogatives and wielded unprecedented power. The scope of the pharaoh&#8217;s realm was so vast that it bordered omnipotence. The will of the pharaoh was the law and disloyalty and disobedience guaranteed capital punishment by snakes and alligators. The Israelis were initially given refugee asylum in Egypt and then were turned into political prisoners and forbidden to continue to enjoy and benefit from Egypt&#8217;s hospitality. Israeli status grew from guests to hostages to captives to slaves to outcasts. No one can fully understand the damage that the Egyptian experience had on the Israeli psyche. The pharaoh showed the rest of the world exactly what he had in mind for every civilization that resisted him through his Israeli demonstration. The pharaoh stripped the Israelis of anything and everything that gave them significance and meaning. Historians tell us that the pharaoh did not permit the Israelis to cook and eat their customary foods, speak their language, wear their clothes, dance, play their music, etc. Some historians tell us that the Israelis were forced to change their customs and stories concerning Adam, Noah, Job, and the other patriarchs to reflect Egyptian sensitivities. Every reference to God was changed to speak of Ra- the Light and the pharaoh, who was understood to be Ra&#8217;s living begotten son. Imagine if somebody today told you to re-learn all of the stories about the early patriarchs but all the chief figures and heroes are Egyptian and all the bad characters were Israeli. The pharaoh effectively saw to it that no one wanted to be of, or in any way linked to, Israel. God eventually purposed to end the abuse and cause another ending for the people of covenant. God superintended every part of their drama, which culminated in the awesome and dreadful display at the Red Sea. Many read the story without appreciating the full import of the meaning. The Red Sea wonder was not directed at just Egypt. Every world leader heard how the Israeli God struck down the divine pharaoh and fame of the incident permanently haunted other leaders with pharaoh-like proclivities. In this scene, the descendants of this grand heritage have a Jordan encounter that rivaled the Red Sea wonder and when the news of it reached the leaders of other nations, the leaders immediately lost the pride and arrogance that fuels the spirit of competition that would contest with Israel. With Israel effectively safe from attack, God tells Joshua to cause the new generation that passed over through the waters to ratify the patriarchal covenant by submitting to circumcision. The new breeds acquiesce. God tells Joshua that on that very day that God removed the reproach of Egypt from them. What is the reproach of Egypt? A reproach is something shameful, scandalous, painful, and ugly. It is something typical of time in prison, slavery, captivity, or bondage. It is something that you don&#8217;t want people to know and something you wish you could forget. This reproach can be public, private, and personal. It could be something you picked up on the way or it could be something you have been dealing with all along. What is very clear is that it required God to remove it and He did not remove it until the people responded to His initiative. When the people responded to God, He removed everything shameful about being in and coming from Egypt. God first took them out of Egypt- then He took Egypt out of them. To the Israelis, this represented a new beginning. This renewal and recommitment was essential to Israeli recovery. Much more can be said on this. What most people miss is that part of the Egyptian experience was the mighty deliverance- and it was this that God used to keep Israel&#8217;s enemies at bay.<\/p>\n<p>I have been experiencing a spiritual renewal. As God has been soundly demonstrating His faithfulness and sovereignty- He has been disciplining me. The discipline resulted because I was betraying my times of renewal thru several shameful and scandalous habits that cause me to sin. Some I&#8217;ve recently picked up and others I&#8217;ve been dealing with all along. I could not understand the cycle and I did not know how to break it. As I began to ask God for help- I was reading this story in my devotional study. I realized that I needed God to remove the reproach of Egypt from me. He mercifully took the scandal out of my story. I had to acknowledge that all of my habits (cursing, lust, sleeping around, deceitfulness, etc.) were symbols of bondage and inconsistent with my new walk with God. When I honestly began to address these issues and when I stopped trying to keep others from discovering and detecting these things about me, I saw the reproach roll away. I tell you I&#8217;ve never been or felt freer and safer than this. None of my enemies have attacked me at my weaknesses because of what God has done in me in their midst. God can give you renewal. When He does, re-commit your life to Him, and let Him remove the reproach of Egypt from you. Let Him use your experiences to silence your enemies.<\/p>\n<p>Then, try letting what happened in Egypt- stay in Egypt.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Focus: Joshua 5:1-9 Joshua is the leader of a new generation of believers.

In a relationship, there can be no faithfulness without love and love cannot continue to flourish without faithfulness. They depend on each other, without one, the other would be dead. Psalm 85:10, &#8220;Love and faithfulness meet together..&#8221; They are patterned and woven together into each other. They have kissed and bonded to become one.<\/p>\n<p>I would not waste time talking about &#8220;love&#8221; because if we can master &#8220;faithfulness&#8221;, we would have mastered &#8220;love&#8221;. Let&#8217;s take the word &#8220;FAITHFULNESS&#8221; and break it into two parts, &#8220;FAITH&#8221; and &#8220;FULLNESS&#8221;. The bible defines faith &#8220;as the assurance (the confirmation) of the things [we] hope for, being the proof of things [we] do not see and the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses (Hebrews 11:1 AMP). In a relationship, it&#8217;s taking what you see as falling and failing and believing that it&#8217;s not always bound to be the same forever therefore laboring to keep it alive and better. You don&#8217;t expect to give up on it when the going gets tough, you keep seeing something good far beyond the natural and reality. The other aspect of faith is &#8220;LOYALTY&#8221;, a choice made by an individual to keep a promise (a vow) he or she made. &#8220;FULLNESS&#8221; is to complete, to give it maximum attention it needs. Give faith a 100% with no doubt of mind and I would term that &#8220;FAITHFULNESS&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>One of the things killing marriages today is lack of faithfulness. Faithfulness is the cornerstone of a relationship. If I was to ask couples today what they would consider the most important thing in their marriage, I bet they would tell me &#8220;FAITHFULNESS&#8221;. Why not love, kindness, respect, support etc as first? It&#8217;s because all these are centered around the word &#8220;FAITHFULNESS&#8221;. Faithfulness involves loving your partner in ways that meet his or her needs. You will love because you are faithful, you will support because you are faithful and you will be kind because you are faithful. Faithfulness implies duty. Faithfulness begins as a choice, the reason Proverbs 3:3, tells us not to &#8220;Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart&#8221;. It&#8217;s the essence of a good Godly blessed marriage (relationship). We can choose to let it leave us by our words and actions. A husband or wife can feel safe knowing their spouse is faithful. Proverbs 20:28 &#8220;Love and faithfulness keep a king (queen) safe; through love his (her) throne is made secure&#8221;. Husbands are kings of their home (throne) and wives are the queens of their home (throne), their aim is to love and be faithful to each other to keep their kingdom safe and secure. If the kingdom is not safe and secure, expect intruders which leads to unfaithfulness. How many have fell on that trap because their kingdoms were not secured by love and faithfulness? Faithfulness (trustworthy) is very fragile, once broken it&#8217;s hard to mend it. The best ways you demonstrate your faithfulness today will build bridges of trust for a life time. Being trustworthy is keeping your word. Don&#8217;t let love and faithfulness leave you if you want you marriage (relationship) to grow and flourish. Write it on the table of your heart and remind yourself everyday to keep them.<\/p>\n<p>Blessings<br \/>\nEvans<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good morning,Proverbs 3:3, &#8220;Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart&#8221; In looking at different passages in the bible, you find that &#8220;LOVE&#8221; and &#8220;FAITHFULNESS&#8221; are joined by the word &#8220;and&#8221;. &#8220;KINDNESS&#8221; and &#8220;FAITHFULNESS&#8221; also appears many times in the bible, these words [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":85630,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"advanced_seo_description":"","jetpack_seo_html_title":"","jetpack_seo_noindex":false,"_crdt_document":"","_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"reader_suggested_tags":"","_jetpack_newsletter_access":"","_jetpack_dont_email_post_to_subs":false,"_jetpack_newsletter_tier_id":0,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paywalled_content":false,"_jetpack_memberships_contains_paid_content":false,"footnotes":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true,"jetpack_social_post_already_shared":false,"jetpack_social_options":{"image_generator_settings":{"template":"highway","default_image_id":0,"font":"","enabled":false},"version":2}},"categories":[70739],"tags":[70739],"class_list":["post-475","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-historymaker","tag-historymaker"],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/pmFP-7F","jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_likes_enabled":true,"jetpack-related-posts":[],"jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/475","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/users\/85630"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/comments?post=475"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/posts\/475\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/media?parent=475"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/categories?post=475"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/public-api.wordpress.com\/wp\/v2\/sites\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/tags?post=475"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}},{"id":473,"date":"2006-03-22T14:38:16","date_gmt":"2006-03-22T14:38:16","guid":{"rendered":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/03\/22\/what-makes-you-burn-by-pastor-phil-4\/"},"modified":"2006-03-22T14:38:16","modified_gmt":"2006-03-22T14:38:16","slug":"what-makes-you-burn-by-pastor-phil-4","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https:\/\/sheeju.wordpress.com\/2006\/03\/22\/what-makes-you-burn-by-pastor-phil-4\/","title":{"rendered":"What makes you burn? By Pastor&nbsp;Phil"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, &#8216;Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures (Luke 24:31 &#8211; 32)?'&#8221;What makes you burn inside and really come alive? What is that sporting event that you shout for your team? I can reference all the Yankee fans here in NYC that screams when the Yankees play and beat their rivals the Boston Red Sox, even though it didn&#8217;t happen this year. Would you come alive if you got that raise at work, or as lawyer won that case or perhaps you were a salesperson and made a big sale? Hiking, swimming, hobbies, computers, dating someone, etc&#8230; are some various things that bring life to people. Perhaps the thing that make you burn with enthusiasm and life was not on the list, but you know what that thing is that makes your heart race. In this passage the thing that made hearts burn, and really come alive was the words that Jesus spoke.<\/p>\n<p>This is the passage of Scripture occurs between the resurrection and the ascension, in the 40-day span of time that Jesus has been raised from the dead, but not yet ascended to the right hand of the Father. The women go to visit the tomb that Jesus had been placed in and they find it vacant. They run and tell the disciples and Peter&#8217;s feet couldn&#8217;t move fast enough to get to the tomb and discover the truth of the women&#8217;s news. And they made their way back to where the rest of the disciples and were reminiscing along the way as to their hearts burning while Jesus talked with them by the way (on the road) and when He opened the Scriptures to them. These had a zeal for the very words of Christ. I asked what makes you come alive; now let me ask you, do the Scriptures make you come alive? Is there a burn in your heart as God speaks to you through them, as you discover something new in that passage you&#8217;ve read many times before, and if not why not? The early Christians are not really so different from us. At one time it was tax collecting for Matthew, bringing in the big catch for the fisherman, and healing that last patient for Luke, that made these men burn with life. But now, I believe that those temporal things were superceded by the life of God&#8217;s word, as there hearts burned at one time for the temporal, now they burned for the spiritual. Jesus said, &#8220;My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work,&#8221; Because it was Jesus&#8217; sustenance. Where is God&#8217;s will found, but in His word. Christian where is your burning heart for God&#8217;s Word? If reading these devotions, and Sunday morning church, or mid-week Bible study is all your time in God&#8217;s word, then it&#8217;s obvious that you&#8217;re not reading for yourself, only being spoon fed by others. I believe it was Charles Spurgeon who said, &#8220;Some of you have so much dust on your Bible that you could write the word damnation with your finger.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Think about it, the hearts of the disciples burned for His word so much that we have four gospels to tell of the things they had seen and heard as reliable eyewitnesses of Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>Click on and check the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.barna.org\/FlexPage.aspx?Page=Topic&amp;TopicID=7\">Barna site<\/a> which shows statistics on Bible reading among Christians.<\/p>\n<p>Why is there testimony not the testimony of believers today? I too get excited about some temporal things, but it does not compare with my excitement over spiritual things. Think of Jeremiah who said &#8220;I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay.&#8221; He tried to keep from preaching God&#8217;s word but like trying to throw gasoline on a forest fire, the flames in his heart blazed out and he had to preach what was in him, because he couldn&#8217;t put a lid on it! God was the consuming fire with Moses on Mt. Sinai, &#8220;For our God is a consuming fire and a jealous God Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: (see Duet 4:24, Heb 12:28-29).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Application: Are you consumed? Does your heart burn like Jeremiah, like the early church? Is your Bible your daily bread that you are enthused about? If so keep it up, if not I challenge you to read at least 15 min a day, record what God is saying to you, and obey what you read.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
